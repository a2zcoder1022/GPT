      Introduction
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. It remains one of the most frequent causes of atypical pneumonia particularly among young adults. Although it is highly transmissible, most infections caused by this organism are relatively minor and include pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and croup with one fifth of infections being asymptomatic. Only 3 -10% of infected subjects develop symptoms consistent with bronchopneumonia and mortality from infection is rare. The organism is fastidious and difficult to grow on cultures. Therefore, diagnosis of infections caused by this organism is usually confirmed with serological tests or polymerase chain reaction-gene amplification techniques. At King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the facility to perform Mycoplasma culture has been available since January 1997. As published information concerning M. pneumoniae infections in Saudi Arabia is scarce, we wished to study the epidemiology and clinical features of culture-proven infections caused by this organism at this hospital.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Institution and patient population
        KAUH is a tertiary care teaching hospital with a bed capacity of 265 beds and annual admissions of 18000 to 19000 patients. Patients with M. pneumoniae positive cultures from respiratory specimens were identified over a 24-months"" period from January, 1997 through December, 1998 for this review.
      
      
        Data collection
        During the study period, respiratory specimens (sputum, nasopharyngeal aspiration, endotracheal secretion, and bronchoalveolar lavage) for M. pneumoniae culture were obtained from patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections seen as inpatients or in the outpatient or emergency departments. Respiratory specimens were aslo Gram-stained and cultured for bacteria and viruses. M. pneumoniae serological tests for IgG or IgM were not available at KAUH during the study period. All positive culture results were obtained from the Microbiology laboratory records. Charts of patients were reviewed with standardized data collection. Information collected included patients' demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, complications, and outcome.
      
      
        Microbiological methods
        M. pneumoniae was cultured using the classic M. pneumoniae agar medium (M.P. agar) and the Pneumofast tray (Pneumofast®, International Microbio, Signes, France). Specimens were processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The M.P. agars and Pneumofast trays were incubated anaerobically at 37°C and inspected daily for 4 weeks. The organism was identified based on typical colonial morphology (granular colonies, rarely fried-egg-like, 10-150 ∝ in diameter) on the M.P. agar medium and the change in the Pneumofast broth color from red to orange then to yellow (glucose fermentation) in the absence of turbidity of the broth. Antibiotic sensitivity profile on the Pneumofast tray was also used for identification according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Bacterial and viral cultures were performed using standard methods.
      
      
        Definitions
        M. pneumoniae isolates were considered community-acquired if they were recovered from unhospitalized patients or within 72 hours of admission to the hospital, and nosocomial if they were recovered beyond that period.
        Pneumonia was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and signs, along with radiographic evidence of pneumonia when possible. Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia associated with tachycardia (>140 /minute), tachypnoea (>30/minute), hypotension (Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure <8 kPa or oxygen saturation <90%), and/or more than 2 areas of consolidation.
        Outcome of patients with M. pneumoniae infection was classified into 4 categories; uneventful recovery, recovery following complications, death due to M. pneumoniae infection, or death unrelated to M. pneumoniae infection.
      
    
    
      Data Analysis
      The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program was used for data analysis. Comparison of categorical data was by Chi-square statistic or Fisher's exact test for small expected values.
    
    
      Results
      A total of 40 respiratory specimens from 40 patients were positive for M. pneumoniae over the 24-months study period. The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. Of all isolates, 37 (92.5%) were community-acquired and 3 (7.5%) were nosocomial. Thirty-three (82.5%) patients required admission to the hospital and the remaining 7 (17.5%) were treated as outpatients. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Of the 24 cases of pneumonia, 21 were confirmed radiologically and the remaining 3 were diagnosed clinically. The two cases of bronchiolitis occurred in 2 children, one and three years old. Thirty-one patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Eleven patients (27.5%) had cardiopulmonary comorbidities (asthma, 8, lung fibrosis, 1, congestive heart failure, 1, congenial heart disease, 1), 9 patients (22.5%) were immunocompromised (malignancy, 7, steroid therapy, 3, Human immunodeficiency virus infection, 1), and 11 patients (27.5%) had other comorbidities (premature newborns, 2, and one each of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorder, sickle cell anemia, Evan's syndrome, Down syndrome, sarcoidosis, demyelinating disease, cerebral palsy, and spinal muscle atrophy). Organisms concomitantly isolated with M. pneumoniae from the respiratory tract included herpes simplex virus type 1 (2 occasions), adenovirus (2 occasions), cytomegalo virus (1 occasion), respiratory syncytial virus (1 occasion), and bacterial isolates (2 occasions: Acinetobacter species, 1, and Enter obacter cloacae, 1).

      Clinical manifestations associated with M. pneumoniae infections are summarized in Table 2. Pneumonia was more common than upper respiratory tract infections (57.5 % versus 27.5%, respectively). Immunocompromised patients were more likely to present with pneumonia as opposed to upper respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis than non-immunocompromised patients (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Similarly, there was a tendency for patients 60 years of age or older to present with pneumonia more frequently than those below 60 (4/4 versus 20/36, P = 0.1). Of the 24 patients with clinically or radiologically confirmed pneumonia, 19 (79.2%) had crepitations and only 6 (25%) had bronchial breath sounds on physical examination. Of the 16 patients in whom wheezes were detected, 9 (56.3%) were not known to have asthma or other obstructive airway disease.

      Discussion
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia accounting for 5-23% of community-acquired pneumonia, In a study of 511 children with acute respiratory tract infection in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was found to be the second most common causative agent after Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounting for 9% of all cases, In a study of 112 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted to a military hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this organism accounted for 6% of all cases, In another retrospective study of 567 pneumonic episodes in adult patients from Al-Qassim area, the organism accounted for 23% of all episodes, The organism also causes other relatively minor infections such as pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and croup. It is transmitted from person-to-person by infected respiratory droplets during close contact. It is most common in school-aged children, military recruits, and college students. Most cases occur singly or as family outbreaks. Larger outbreaks can also occur in closed populations such as military recruit camps or boarding schools, Infection occurs most frequently during the fall and winter in temperate climates but may develop year-round, The average incubation period is 3 weeks following exposure, Although rare, complications are protean and may involve virtually any organ system such as the respiratory system (e.g.: pleurisy, pneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung abscess), the hematologic system (e.g.: hemolytic anemia, intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia), the dermatologic system (e.g.: maculopapular or urticarial rashes, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum), the musculoskeletal system (e.g.: myalgias, arthralgias, arthritis), the cardiovascular system (e.g.: pericarditis, myocarditis), the nervous system (e.g.: meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuropathies, acute psychosis), or the eye (optic disc edema, optic nerve atrophy, retinal exudation and hemorrhages). Immunity following infection is not long lasting.
      In our study, the infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and preschool children (22.5%), and least common in adults aged 15 to 30 years (2.5%) and elderly above 70 years of age (5%). This contrasts with data from temperate countries where the infection is most common in school-aged children, and young adults. One possible explanation for this difference is that infants and preschool children perhaps had more severe infections than did school-aged children, and young adults which prompted presentation of the former group to the hospital. The infection occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%), and spring (30%), and least common in the summer (10%). Most infections were community-acquired (92.5%).
      More than one half of patients (57.5%) presented with pneumonia, and about a third (27.5%) presented with upper respiratory tract infection, Immunocompromised patients and patients 60 years of age or older were more likely to present with pneumonia as opposed to upper respiratory tract infection than non-immunocompromised patients or those below 60 years of age. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Cough was usually dry or slightly productive of white sputum and mild to moderate in severity. Most febrile patients had mild to moderate fever of 39°C or less; high-grade fever of more than 39°C was rare. Crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Wheezes were as common in patients with no history of obstructive airway disease (9 patients) as it was in those with such a history (7 patients). Bronchial breathing as a sign of consolidation was detected in only one fourth of patients with pneumonia, which is consistent with the known disparity between clinical and radiological signs of M pneumoniae pneumonia. Crepitations, however, were detected in the majority (79.2%) of patients. Pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion were rare.
      More than half (56.5%) of the patients with pneumonia had uneventful recovery. Mortality from M. pneumoniae pneumonia was high (12.5%) and occurred only in patients with underlying comorbidities. None of the 9 patients with no underlying comorbidities died of M pneumoniae pneumonia. The relatively high complications rate (16.7%) and mortality (12.5%) related to M. pneumoniae pneumonia are likely due to selection bias as most patients with pneumonia were sick enough to require admission to the hospital (21/24 or 87.5%) and most of them had comorbidities (20/24 or 83.3%).
      In conclusion, our data shed some light on the epidemiology and clinical features of M pneumoniae infections in one of the Saudi tertiary care centers. The data are comparable to those of other countries except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children than in school children and young adults. Additionally, mortality attributable to M. pneumoniae pneumonia was relatively high in patients with comorbidities. It is hoped this information will assist clinicians in their approach and management of respiratory tract infections.

      Introduction
      Since its discovery as a biological messenger molecule more than 10 years ago, the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO•) is now well recognized for its involvement in diverse biological processes, including vasodilation, bronchodilation, neurotransmission, tumor surveillance, antimicrobial defense and regulation of inflammatory-immune processes . In the respiratory tract, NO• is generated enzymically by three distinct isoforms of NO• synthase (NOS-1, NOS-2 and NOS-3) that are present to different extents in numerous cell types, including airway and alveolar epithelial cells, neuronal cells, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. In contrast with the other two NOS isoforms (NOS-1 and NOS-3), which are expressed constitutively and activated by mediator-induced or stress-induced cell activation, NOS-2 activity is primarily regulated transcriptionally and is commonly induced by bacterial products and pro-inflammatory cytokines. As such, inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, such as asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchiectasis, are commonly characterized by an increased expression of NOS-2 within respiratory epithelial and inflammatory-immune cells, and a markedly elevated local production of NO•, presumably as an additional host defense mechanism against bacterial or viral infections. The drawback of such excessive NO• production is its accelerated metabolism to a family of potentially harmful reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), especially in the presence of phagocyte-generated oxidants. The formation of such RNS is thought to be the prime reason why NO• can in many cases contribute to the etiology of inflammatory lung disease . Despite extensive research into both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions of NO•, the overall contribution of NO• to inflammatory conditions of the lung is not easily predicted and seems to depend on many factors, such as the site, time and degree of NO• production in relation to the local redox status, and the acute or chronic nature of the immune response. In addition, our current understanding of the pro-inflammatory or pro-injurious mechanisms of NO• or related RNS is incomplete; this commentary will focus primarily on these latter aspects.
    
    
      Evidence for a pro-inflammatory role of NO• in the respiratory tract
      To explore a role for NO• (or NOS) in infectious or inflammatory diseases, two general research approaches have been taken: the use of pharmacological inhibitors of NOS isoenzymes, and the targeted deletion of individual NOS enzymes in mice. Both approaches suffer from the shortcoming that animal models of respiratory tract diseases generally do not faithfully reflect human disease. The use of NOS inhibitors to determine the contribution of individual NOS isoenzymes is also hindered by problems related to specificity and pharmacokinetic concerns. However, the unconditional gene disruption of one or more NOS isoforms, leading to lifelong deficiency, can have a markedly different outcome from pharmacological inhibition at a certain stage of disease, as the involvement of individual NOS isoenzymes can be different depending on disease stage and severity. Despite these inherent limitations, studies with the targeted deletion of NOS isoforms have led to some insights, indicating a role for NO• and NOS-2 in the etiology of some inflammatory lung diseases. For instance, mice deficient in NOS-2 are less susceptible to lethality after intranasal inoculation with influenza A virus, suffer less lung injury after administration of endotoxin, and display reduced allergic eosinophilia in airways and lung injury in a model of asthma, than their wild-type counterparts . However, although the contribution of NOS-2 is expected in inflammatory conditions, recent studies have determined that NOS-1, rather than NOS-2, seems to be primarily involved in the development of airway hyper-reactivity in a similar asthma model . The linkage of NOS-1 to the etiology of asthma was more recently supported in asthmatic humans by an association of a NOS-1 gene polymorphism with this disease, although the physiological basis for this association remains unclear .
      Despite the potential contribution of NOS-2-derived NO• to lung injury after endotoxemia, the sequestration of neutrophils in the lung and their adhesion to postcapillary and postsinusoidal venules after administration of endotoxin were found to be markedly increased in NOS-2-deficient mice, and NOS-2 deficiency did not alleviate endotoxin-induced mortality. It therefore seems that the `harmful' and `protective' effects of NOS-2 might contend with each other within the same model, which makes the assessment of the potential role of NOS in human disease even more difficult. In this context, it is interesting to note that humans or animals with cystic fibrosis have subnormal levels of NOS-2 in their respiratory epithelium, related to a gene mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator . This relative absence of epithelial NOS-2 might be one of the contributing factors behind the excessively exuberant respiratory tract inflammatory response in patients with cystic fibrosis, even in the absence of detectable respiratory infections. Overall, the apparently contrasting findings associated with NOS deficiency, together with concerns about animal disease models used, make interpretations and conclusions with regard to human lung disease all the more difficult.
      Pharmacological inhibitors of NOS have also been found to reduce oxidative injury in several animal models of lung injury, such as ischemia/reperfusion, radiation, paraquat toxicity, and endotoxemia (see, for example, ). However, results are again not always consistent, and in some cases NOS inhibition has been found to worsen lung injury, indicating anti-inflammatory or protective roles for NO•. All in all, despite these inconsistencies, there is ample evidence from such studies to suggest a contributing role of NO• in various respiratory disease conditions, which continues to stimulate research into mechanistic aspects underlying such pro-inflammatory roles and modulation of NO• generation as a potential therapeutic target.
    
    
      Injurious properties of NO•: a role for ONOO-?
      Although the pro-inflammatory and injurious effects of NO• might be mediated by a number of diverse mechanisms, it is commonly assumed that such actions are largely due to the generation of reactive by-products generated during the oxidative metabolism of NO•; these are collectively termed RNS. One of the prime suspects commonly implicated in the adverse or injurious properties of NO• is ONOO-, a potent oxidative species formed by its almost diffusion-limited reaction with superoxide (O2•-), which is a product of activated phagocytes and of endothelial or epithelial cells . The formation of ONOO- seems highly feasible under conditions of elevated production of both NO• and O2•-in vivo, and its oxidative and cytotoxic potential is well documented . However, because the direct detection of ONOO- under inflammatory conditions is virtually impossible because of its instability and high reactivity, the formation of ONOO-in vivo can be demonstrated only by indirect methods. Thus, many investigators have relied on the analysis of characteristic oxidation products in biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA, most notably free or protein-associated 3-nitrotyrosine, a product of tyrosine oxidation that can be formed by ONOO- (and several other RNS) but not by NO• itself (see, for example, ). Indeed, elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine have been observed in many different inflammatory conditions of the respiratory tract , which illustrates the endogenous formation of ONOO- or related RNS in these cases. However, without known evidence for functional consequences of (protein) tyrosine nitration, the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine should not be regarded as direct proof of a pro-inflammatory role of NO•. Moreover, although the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine has in most cases been interpreted as conclusive evidence for the formation of ONOO-in vivo (see, for example, ), it should be realized that other RNS formed by alternative mechanisms might also contribute to endogenous tyrosine nitration. Indeed, it has recently become clear that the presence of inflammatory-immune cells, and specifically their heme peroxidases myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), can catalyze the oxidization of NO• and/or its metabolite NO2- to more reactive RNS and thereby contribute to protein nitration . This notion is further supported by the fact that 3-nitrotyrosine is commonly detected in tissues affected by active inflammation, mostly in and around these phagocytic cells and macrophages, which can also contain active peroxidases originating from apoptotic neutrophils or eosinophils. Hence, the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in vivo cannot be used as direct proof of the formation of ONOO-, but merely indicates the formation of RNS by multiple oxidative pathways, possibly including ONOO-but more probably involving the activity of phagocyte peroxidases . In this regard, a preliminary study with EPO-deficient mice has recently demonstrated the critical importance of EPO in the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in a mouse model of asthma . Future studies with animals deficient in MPO and/or EPO will undoubtedly help to clarify this issue.
    
    
      Protein tyrosine nitration in the lung: does it really matter?
      Given the considerable interest in 3-nitrotyrosine as a collective marker of the endogenous formation of NO•-derived RNS, the crucial question remains of whether the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine adequately reflects the toxic or injurious properties of NO•. The formation of ONOO- (or of other RNS that can induce tyrosine nitration) might in fact represent a mechanism of decreasing excessive levels of NO• that might exert pro-inflammatory actions by other mechanisms. For instance, NO• can promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines or cyclo-oxygenase (responsible for the formation of inflammatory prostanoids) by mechanisms independent of ONOO- , and the removal of NO• would minimize these responses. Furthermore, although ONOO- or related NO•-derived oxidants can be cytotoxic or induce apoptosis, these effects might not necessarily relate to their ability to cause protein nitration (see, for example, ). For instance, the bactericidal and cytotoxic properties of ONOO- are minimized by the presence of CO2, even though aromatic nitration and other radical-induced modifications are enhanced . Similarly, the presence of NO2- in the incubation medium decreases the cytotoxicity of MPO-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl) toward epithelial cells or bacteria, despite increased tyrosine nitration of cellular proteins (A van der Vliet and M Syvanen, unpublished data). Thus, it would seem that the cytotoxic properties of NO• and/or its metabolites might instead be mediated through preferred reactions with other biological targets, and these might not necessarily be correlated with the degree of tyrosine nitration. The extent of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in bronchial biopsies of asthmatic patients was correlated directly with measured levels of exhaled NO• and inversely with the provocation concentration for methacholine (PC20) and forced expiratory volume in 1s . However, an immunohistochemical analysis of nitrotyrosine and apoptosis in pulmonary tissue samples from lung transplant recipients did not identify patients with an imminent risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis . It is therefore still unclear to what degree tyrosine nitration relates to disease progression.
      Several studies with purified enzymes have suggested that nitration of critical tyrosine residues adversely affects enzyme activity, but there is as yet no conclusive evidence in vivo for biological or cellular changes as a direct result of tyrosine nitration . For instance, tyrosine nitration was suggested to have an effect on cellular pathways by affecting cytoskeletal proteins or tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby affecting processes involved in, for example, cell proliferation or differentiation . Recent studies have provided support for selective tyrosine nitration within certain proteins  and of selective cellular targets for nitration by RNS (see, for example, ), and such specificity might indicate a potential physiological role for this protein modification. However, in none of these cases could tyrosine nitration be linked directly to changes in enzyme function. Chemical studies have indicated that tyrosine nitration by RNS accounts for only a minor fraction of oxidant involved, and reactions with other biological targets (thiols, selenoproteins, or transition metal ions) are much more prominent . Indeed, the extent of tyrosine nitration in vivo is very low (1-1000 per 106 tyrosine residues according to best estimates ), although different analytical methods used to detect 3-nitrotyrosine in biological systems have often given inconsistent results. It is important to note that recent rigorous studies have unveiled substantial sources of artifact during sample preparation, which might frequently have led to an overestimation of tyrosine nitration in vivo in previous studies .
      On the basis of current knowledge, the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine seems to be merely a marker of NO•-derived oxidants, with as yet questionable pathophysiological significance. In view of the low efficiency of tyrosine nitration by biological RNS, and the endogenous presence of variable factors that influence protein nitration (antioxidants or other RNS scavengers), it seems unlikely that tyrosine nitration is a reliable mechanism of, for example, enzyme regulation. Nevertheless, the recent discovery of enzymic `denitration' mechanisms that can reverse tyrosine nitration  merits further investigation of the possibility that tyrosine nitration might reflect a signaling pathway, for example analogous to tyrosine phosphorylation or sulfation.
    
    
      Direct and indirect signaling properties of NO•				
      The biological effects of NO• are mediated by various actions, either by NO• itself or by secondary RNS, and the overall biochemistry of NO• is deceptively complex. Moreover, the metabolism and chemistry of NO• depend importantly on local concentrations and pH; the recently described acidification of the airway surface in asthmatics  might significantly affect NO• metabolism in these patients. It is well known that interactions with the ion centers of iron or other transition metals are responsible for many of the signaling properties of NO•; the activation of the heme enzyme guanylyl cyclase and the consequent formation of cGMP is involved not only in smooth-muscle relaxation but also in the activation of certain transcription factors, the expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes (including cytokines and cyclo-oxygenase), and the production of respiratory mucus . In addition to such direct signaling properties, many actions of NO• might be due largely to secondary RNS that can react with multiple additional targets, in some cases forming nitroso or nitro adducts as potentially unique NO•-mediated signaling mechanisms. As discussed, the formation of protein nitrotyrosine has been postulated as a potential RNS-specific signaling pathway. Even more interest has been given to the reversible S-nitros(yl)ation of protein cysteine residues, which has been proposed to affect a number of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, for example by the activation of p21ras or the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases . Similar modifications of reactive cysteine residues in transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB or of caspases contribute to the regulation of gene expression and apoptosis . The precise mechanisms leading to protein S-nitrosylation in vivo are still not clarified, but might involve dinitrogen trioxide (formed during the autoxidation of NO•), iron-nitrosyl complexes, and perhaps ONOO-; changes in NO• metabolism during inflammatory lung diseases undoubtedly affect such NO• -dependent signaling pathways. In addition, S-nitrosylation can be reversed by either enzymic (thioredoxin or glutaredoxin) or chemical (metals or oxidants) mechanisms, and evidence is increasing that this reversible modification is complementary to more widely accepted oxidant-dependent redox signaling pathways . The reported alterations in S-nitrosothiol levels in tracheal secretions of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis further point to altered NO• metabolism in these cases, and might provide new clues to the role of S-nitrosylation in controlling such disease processes . Unfortunately, technical limitations to detect S-nitrosylation in specific protein targets in vivo have limited a full understanding of this potential signaling pathway; further research in these areas can be expected to establish more clearly its significance in the pathophysiological properties of NO•.
    
    
      What is to come?
      Despite the by now overwhelming evidence for the increased formation of NO• and NO•-derived oxidants in many different lung diseases, the exact contribution of NO• or its metabolites to inflammatory lung disease is still unclear. Indeed, NO• might have distinctly different roles in different stages of respiratory tract inflammatory diseases, being pro-inflammatory or pro-injurious in acute and severe stages but perhaps being protective and anti-inflammatory in more stable conditions; it is uncertain whether NOS is a suitable therapeutic target in the management of inflammatory lung disease. Caution is clearly needed when interpreting observations of tyrosine nitration in animal models of disease or in human tissues, which does not automatically implicate ONOO- (as often thought), but rather indicates the formation of RNS by various mechanisms. Furthermore, animal models of chronic lung disease that usually reflect short-term or acute inflammation might not always be applicable to chronic airway diseases in humans. For instance, phagocyte degranulation, a common feature observed in association with human airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma, does not seem to occur in mouse models of asthma . Therefore the importance of granule proteins, such as heme peroxidases, in the pathology of human airway diseases might not be adequately reflected in such animal models. More work with animal models more characteristic of human diseases or with biopsy materials from human subjects will be required to unravel the precise role of NO• in inflammatory lung disease, and might establish more clearly whether the pharmacological inhibition of NOS isoenzymes can be beneficial. This brings up the interesting paradox that, despite presumed adverse roles of NO• in such inflammatory lung diseases as septic shock and ARDS, NO• inhalation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to improve overall gas exchange . Intriguingly, in a rat model of endotoxemia, inhalation of NO• was found to reduce neutrophilic inflammation and protein nitration , again supporting the crucial involvement of inflammatory-immune cells in this protein modification.
      For a better assessment of the role of NO• in respiratory tract diseases in humans, the production of RNS and/or characteristic markers would need to be more carefully monitored during various disease stages. Care should be given to analytical techniques, their quantitative capacity and the possibility of artifacts. The monitoring of exhaled NO•, although convenient and non-invasive, does not reflect the actual production or fate of NO• in the respiratory tract and is not well correlated with NOS activity in the lung . We therefore need to continue research into the local biochemistry of NO• in the lung, taking into account the presence of secreted or phagocyte peroxidases and possible changes in local pH, as in asthmatic airways , that might modulate NO• activity and metabolism. This might result in a better understanding of relationships between the various metabolic endproducts of NO• (NO2-, NO3-, or nitroso and nitro adducts) and its pro-inflammatory or injurious properties.

      Introduction
      Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is a member of the collagenous subfamily of calcium-dependent lectins (collectins) that includes pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) and the serum mannose-binding lectin . Collectins interact with a wide variety of microorganisms, lipids, and organic particulate antigens, and can modulate the function of immune effector cells and their responses to these ligands. This article reviews what is currently known about the sites of production, structure, function, and regulated expression of SP-D. Emphasis will be placed on functional attributes, known ligand interactions, and structure-function relationships believed to be important for host defense. For additional information on SP-A and other members of the collectin family, the reader is referred to other recent reviews .
    
    
      Sites of SP-D production
      SP-D is synthesized and secreted into the airspaces of the lung by the respiratory epithelium . At the alveolar level, SP-D is constitutively synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells. More proximally in the lung, SP-D is secreted by a subset of bronchiolar epithelial cells, the non-ciliated Clara cells. Because SP-D is stored within the secretory granules of Clara cells , it seems likely that SP-D is subject to regulated secretion via granule exocytosis at this level of the respiratory tract. In some species, SP-D is also synthesized by epithelial cells and/or submucosal glands associated with the bronchi and trachea . Although many alveolar macrophages show strong cytoplasmic and/or membrane labeling with antibody against SP-D, they do not contain detectable SP-D message.
      The lung seems to be the major site of SP-D production. However, there is increasing evidence for extrapulmonary sites of expression as assessed with monoclonal or affinity-purified antibodies, reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR), and/or hybridization assays of tissues from humans and other large mammals  (summarized in Table 1). It is difficult to entirely exclude cross-reactions or amplification of related sequences; however, localization to many of these sites in human tissues was confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies in combination with RT-PCR with sequencing of the amplified products . Non-pulmonary expression seems to be largely restricted to cells lining epithelial surfaces or ducts and certain glandular epithelial cells that are in direct or indirect continuity with the environment. Notable exceptions to this generalization might include heart, brain, pancreatic islets, and testicular Leydig cells. SP-D has also been identified in amnionic epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry ; however, it is unclear whether this is synthesized locally or derived from the lung by way of the amniotic fluid. Interestingly, in many of these sites SP-D microscopically co-localizes with gp-340, an SP-D binding protein and putative SP-D receptor .
      Sites of extrapulmonary expression have also been described in small mammals. In the rat, SP-D message was identified in RNA extracted from skin and blood vessel , and both protein and message were identified in gastric mucosa  and mesentery . Using RT-PCR, SP-D message has also been identified in mouse stomach, heart, and kidney .

      SP-D (43 kDa, reduced) consists of at least four discrete structural domains: a short, N-terminal domain; a relatively long collagenous domain, a short amphipathic connecting peptide or coiled-coil neck domain, and a C-terminal, C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Each molecule consists of trimeric subunits (3 × 43 kDa), which associate at their N-termini (Fig. 1). Although most preparations of SP-D contain a predominance of dodecamers (that is, four trimeric subunits), the proportions of various oligomers vary between species. For example, rat lavage and recombinant rat SP-D are almost exclusively assembled as dodecamers (four trimers), whereas recombinant human SP-D is secreted as trimers, dodecamers and higher-order multimers . SP-D isolated from the lavage of some patients with alveolar proteinosis consists predominantly of higher-order multimers, which can contain up to 32 (or more) trimeric subunits (Fig. 1).

        Neck and CRDs
        Recent crystallographic and mutagenesis studies suggest that the structural determinants of saccharide binding are similar to those originally described for mannose-binding lectin . At least two bound calcium ions and two intrachain disulfide crosslinks stabilize the required tertiary structure, and Glu321 and Asn323 within the CRD participate in glucose/mannose type recognition. Interactions with at least one glycolipid ligand, phosphatidylinositol (PI), require the participation of the C-terminal end of the protein .
        A trimeric cluster of CRDs is necessary for high-affinity binding to carbohydrate ligands . The crystal structure of human SP-D suggests that the spatial distribution of CRDs within a trimeric subunit permits simultaneous and cooperative interactions with two or three glycoconjugates displayed on the surface of a particulate ligand . Furthermore, solid-phase binding studies have shown that monomeric CRDs have an approximately 10-fold lower binding affinity for multivalent ligands than trimeric CRDs.
        Crystallographic studies of human SP-D further suggest that the spatial organization of CRDs within a trimer is stabilized by interactions of the C-terminal sequence with the trimeric neck domain . Interestingly, the three CRDs show a deviation from threefold asymmetry, suggesting some flexibility of the CRDs in relation to the neck. Thus, the dependence of the binding of PI on the C-terminal sequence could reflect conformational effects, rather than the direct participation of this sequence in ligand interactions.
      
      
        Collagen domain
        The collagen domain length of SP-D is highly conserved and lacks interruptions in the repeating Gly-X-Y sequence(in which X and Y are different amino acids). As for other collagenous proteins, this domain is enriched in imino acids and contains hydroxyproline. Unlike SP-A, SP-D also contains hydroxylysine. Although the collagen domain of rat, human, bovine, and mouse SP-D lacks cysteine residues, cDNA sequencing has identified a codon for cysteine within the collagen domain of pig SP-D ; this suggests the possibility of alternative patterns of chain association and oligomeric assembly for pig SP-D.
        The first translated exon of SP-D contains a highly conserved and unusually hydrophilic Gly-X-Y sequence that shows little homology with the remainder of the collagen sequence. The functional significance of this region is unknown. However, it has been suggested that this region contributes to oligomer assembly or mediates interactions with cellular receptors.
        The collagen domain determines the maximal spatial separation of trimeric, C-terminal lectin domains within SP-D molecules, but might also contribute to normal oligomeric assembly and secretion. For example, deletion of the entire collagen domain of rat SP-D results in the secretion of trimers rather than dodecamers . In addition, 2,2-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylation that interferes with the formation of a stable collagen helix, causes the intracellular accumulation of 43 kDa monomers and dimers . In any case, the complete conservation of the number of Gly-X-Y triplets suggests that the spatial separation of trimeric CRDs is critical for normal SP-D function.
      
      
        N-terminal domain
        The N-terminal peptide of the mature protein contains two conserved cysteine residues at positions 15 and 20. These residues participate in interchain disulfide crosslinks that stabilize the trimer, as well as the N-terminal association of four or more trimeric subunits. Stable oligomerization of trimeric subunits permits cooperative or bridging interactions between spatially separated binding sites on the same surface or on different particles.
        The process of forming interchain disulfide bonds is complex, and appropriate crosslinking of the N-terminal domains might be rate limiting for secretion . Subcellular fractionation studies suggest that interchain bonds form initially between the three chains of a trimeric subunit. Subsequent rearrangements within the rough endoplasmic reticulum might allow the covalent crosslinking of a single chain from one subunit and two crosslinked chains of another, with the associated elimination of free thiol groups. Mutant proteins that contain unpaired N-terminal cysteine residues are not secreted. However, it is unclear whether this results from abnormalities in disulfide bonding itself, or the failure to stabilize the required N-terminal conformation.
      
      
        Glycosylation of SP-D
        The collagen domain contains hydroxylysyl-derived glycosides and a single N-linked oligosaccharide. In most species (human, rat, mouse, and cow) the site of N-linked glycosylation is located near the N-terminal end of the collagenous domain. Recently, it was shown that pig SP-D has an additional potential site of N-linked glycosylation within the CRD . Although rat and human lung lavage SP-D seem to be sialylated, as suggested by charge heterogeneity and cleavage with highly purified neuraminidase, preparations of human amniotic fluid and bovine lavage SP-D recovered from amniotic fluid showed predominantly complex type biantennary structures and no sialic acid .
        A variant form of SP-D (50 kDa) has been identified in lavage from a subset of human lavage samples; this protein shows O-linked glycosylation of threonyl residues within the N-terminal peptide domain . At present, the functional significance of these sugars is not known. The presence of O-linked glycosylation within the N-terminal domain might be predicted to interfere with normal dodecamer assembly. In this regard, the O-glycosylated 50 kDa form of human SP-D is recovered as trimeric subunits or smaller species.
        As for many glycoproteins, the functional role of the attached carbohydrate is unknown. Mutational analysis has shown that the N-linked sugar on rat SP-D is not required for secretion, for dodecamer formation, or for interactions with a variety of microorganisms .
      
    
    
      SP-D ligands
      Consistent with its designation as a `mannose-type' C-type lectin, SP-D preferentially binds to simple and complex saccharides containing mannose, glucose, or inositol . SP-D also interacts with specific constituents of pulmonary surfactant including PI  and glucosylceramide . Binding to glucosylceramide involves interactions of the carbohydrate-binding sequences of the CRD with the glucosyl moiety. However, the interaction of SP-D with PI involves interactions with the lipid, as well as CRD-dependent interactions with the inositol moiety .
      Microorganisms are surfaced with a diverse and complex array of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, and most classes of microorganism contain one or more sugars recognized by SP-D. However, the outcome of this interaction depends on the specific organism and can be modified by the conditions of microbial growth. The potential consequences of this interaction include the following: varying degrees of lectin-dependent aggregation (namely, microbial agglutination), enhanced binding of microorganisms or microbial aggregates to their `receptors' on host cells, phagocyte activation, and opsonic enhancement of phagocytosis and killing, potentially involving one or more cellular receptors for SP-D.

      Interactions of SP-D with microorganisms
      
        Gram-negative bacteria
        SP-D binds to many - if not most - species of Gram-negative bacteria including such important pulmonary pathogens as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae  (Table 2). However, SP-D also binds to certain Gram-positive organisms including strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus , and to mycobacteria . Binding to organisms in suspension is often - but not always - accompanied by some degree of aggregation.
        
          Mechanisms of interaction
          SP-D binds to purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from a variety of Gram-negative organisms . In addition, LPS is the major cell wall component that is labeled on lectin blotting of outer membranes isolated from Escherichia coli . The latter interactions involve the recognition of the core oligosaccharide domain, which contains glucose and heptose . SP-D interacts preferentially with purified LPS molecules characterized by short or absent O-antigens and preferentially agglutinates bacterial strains expressing a predominance of rough (O-antigen-deficient) LPS .
          Although the core oligosaccharide domain of LPS constitutes the major ligand for SP-D on at least some Gram-negative bacteria, the mechanism of interaction with this group of microorganisms is probably heterogeneous. SP-D binds to some smooth, unencapsulated strains of Gram-negative bacteria by immunofluorescence. The mechanism is uncertain; the quantity or quality of binding differs from that observed for rough strains and does not necessarily result in agglutination. LPS molecules on the surfaces of bacteria show heterogeneity in the extent of maturation, so it is possible that this interaction is mediated by a subpopulation of LPS with deficient O-antigens and that the density of binding sites is too low for high-affinity binding.
        
        
          Determinants of binding to cell wall LPS
          The recognition of the surface glycoconjugates on Gram-negative bacteria by SP-D depends not only on the expression of lectin-specific residues by a given strain or species, but also on the accessibility of these residues . For example, SP-D binds inefficiently to the core region of LPS of encapsulated Klebsiella, but efficiently agglutinates the corresponding unencapsulated phase variants. Interactions of SP-D with the core oligosaccharides of Gram-negative organisms are also influenced by the number of repeating saccharide units associated with the terminal O-antigen of the LPS .
        
        
          Other Gram-negative ligands
          Other potential ligands include the O-antigen domain of LPS, certain capsular polysaccharides, and membrane-associated glycoproteins. In this regard, SP-D can bind to di-mannose containing O-antigens expressed by a subset of Klebsiella serotypes (I Ofek, H Sahly and EC Crouch, unpublished data). Although other C-type lectins, specifically SP-A and the mannose receptor, can interact with specific capsular polysaccharides , a specific interaction of SP-D with capsular glycoconjugates or exopolysaccharides has not been described.
        
      
      
        Other bacterial organisms
        
          Gram-positive bacteria
          The mechanism of interaction with Gram-positive organisms has not been elucidated. Lipoteichoic acids, which are the major glycolipids associated with the Gram-positive cell wall, do not detectably compete with LPS for binding to SP-D (I Ofek, A Mesika, M Kalina, Y Keisari, D Chang, D McGregor and EC Crouch, manuscript submitted). In preliminary studies we observed that binding was competed only partly with maltose and/or EDTA, raising the possibility that binding might be more complex than for some Gram-negative organisms.
        
        
          Mycobacteria
          Recently, SP-D was shown to interact with the terminal mannosyl-oligosaccharides of lipoarabinomannan from Mycobacterium tuberculosis .
        
      
      
        Cellular consequences of SP-D binding to bacteria
        The consequences of binding with regard to host cell function are not always predictable. Opsonization of mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa with rat SP-D enhanced the internalization by alveolar macrophages, and these experiments further suggested the involvement of a cellular receptor for SP-D . Interestingly, the organisms were not detectably aggregated by SP-D. Similarly, human SP-D enhanced the internalization and killing of unencapsulated phase variants of Klebsiella pneumoniae  (I Ofek, A Mesika, M Kalina, Y Keisari, D Chang, D McGregor and EC Crouch, manuscript submitted). However, unlike the situation reported for P. aeruginosa, the organisms showed varying degrees of aggregation; some of the largest aggregates were identified in association with the macrophage membrane, but were not internalized. In other studies, human proteinosis SP-D did not enhance the internalization of E. coli J5, a rough laboratory strain, by rat alveolar macrophages, despite efficient bacterial agglutination . In addition, SP-D inhibited the adherence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to monocyte-derived macrophages, despite efficient microbial aggregation .
        Rat and human SP-D enhanced the binding and uptake of E. coli K12, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus by human neutrophils . However, similar effects were observed when the neutrophils were preincubated with SP-D, and there was only a slight enhancement of uptake when bacteria were incubated with human SP-D and washed before their addition to neutrophils. Notably, the extent of binding and internalization was dependent on the extent of multimerization, with human SP-D multimers demonstrating the highest potency. Differences in cell type, the extent of SP-D multimerization, or differences in size or organization of bacterial aggregates could account for some of the apparent inconsistencies.
      
      
        Interactions with bacterial endotoxin
        Although LPS mediates the binding of SP-D to at least some Gram-negative bacteria, SP-D can also bind to specific forms of soluble LPS, particularly `rough' or O-antigen-deficient forms . Because soluble LPS can modulate a variety of cellular responses and is the key mediator of Gram-negative sepsis, such interactions could have considerable biological significance. Several observations suggest a potential protective role of SP-D in the host response to endotoxin. For example, SP-D can bind to intratracheally instilled LPS in rats, and the resulting complexes are rapidly internalized into lysosomal compartments in alveolar macrophages . In addition, as discussed below, preliminary studies suggest that transgenic mice deficient in SP-D develop more intense inflammation in response to intratracheal challenge with LPS . Of particular interest is the recent observation that SP-D can bind directly to oligosaccharides on sCD14, a soluble form of one component of the LPS receptor complex, and modify its interactions with LPS .
        Although SP-A can bind to LPS, the interaction is mechanistically different and involves interactions with the lipid A domain, and perhaps saccharides associated with certain O-antigens. Human SP-A, but not SP-D, increases the uptake and deacylation of tritiated E. coli LPS by isolated alveolar macrophages , but the biological significance of this finding is uncertain.
      
      
        Pneumocystis and fungi
        
          Pneumocystis
          SP-D binds in a CRD-dependent manner to gpA (gp-140), a heavily mannosylated glycoprotein associated with the trophozoites and cysts of Pneumocystis carinii . SP-D can also bind to cell wall β-glucans . SP-D binding enhances the association of Pneumocystis carinii with rat alveolar macrophages; however, the bound organisms are not efficiently internalized or killed in vitro .
        
        
          True fungi
          SP-D interacts with most of the clinically important fungal pathogens including Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans . We have also observed binding to clinical isolates of Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis (SF Kuan, S Moser and E Crouch, unpublished data). In all cases reported so far, binding is accompanied by agglutination. In particular, SP-D efficiently agglutinates Aspergillus fumigatus conidia  and Candida albicans . Although SP-D also shows CRD-dependent agglutination of unencapsulated forms of Cryptococcus neoformans, no significant binding to encapsulated organisms was observed .
          There is still relatively little information on the mechanism of SP-D binding to fungi. However, SP-D shows CRD-dependent binding to the N-linked sugars of specific cell wall glycoproteins, including major glycoprotein allergens, of Aspergillus fumigatus . Because SP-D shows lectin-dependent binding to wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as to mutants with low levels of mannosylphosphate in the cell wall, the interactions probably do not involve N-linked phosphomannan sugars . The observation that SP-D interacts with β-glucans on the surface of Pneumocystis  suggests that these glycoconjugates, which are abundant in the cell walls of true fungi, could serve as ligands for SP-D.
          As for bacteria, the effects of SP-D binding on the phagocytic response to fungi are somewhat controversial. Human SP-D enhances the oxidative response to, and internalization and killing of, Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human alveolar macrophages and blood neutrophils . However, other investigators observed binding of rat and human SP-D to conidia but found no enhancement of internalization by rat alveolar macrophages . Furthermore, rat SP-D inhibits the phagocytosis of Candida albicans by these cells .
          In the latter study the authors suggested that fungal aggregation inhibits phagocytosis. Interestingly, SP-D binding directly inhibited fungal growth and decreased the outgrowth of pseudohyphae, the invasive form of the fungus, in the absence of phagocytic cells . It is possible that these effects are also secondary to agglutination, possibly as result of nutrient deprivation.
        
      
      
        Respiratory viruses
        Purified rat and human SP-D inhibit the infectivity and hemagglutination activity of influenza A virus (IAV) in vitro . This activity is calcium-dependent, inhibited by carbohydrate ligands, and involves the binding of SP-D to high-mannose oligosaccharides associated with the HA1domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule. Because the high-mannose oligosaccharide on the HA1 domain over-lies the sialic acid-binding pocket (the cell attachment site) of the HA, binding can interfere sterically with HA activity and cellular attachment. SP-D also binds to the neuraminidase of IAV and inhibits neuraminidase enzyme activity .
        SP-D induces massive aggregation of IAV particles . Viral aggregation is calcium-dependent, inhibited by competing sugars, and directly correlated with the multimerization state of SP-D. Highly multimerized preparations of SP-D are significantly more potent than dodecamers. In particular, minimal agglutination is induced with trimeric CRDs. Massive agglutination of organisms could contribute to lung host defense by promoting airway mucociliary clearance, but it might also influence the internalization by phagocytic cells.
        SP-D enhances the binding and uptake of IAV by neutrophils , and these effects are highly dependent on the extent of multimerization of SP-D and its ability to agglutinate the viral particles . The enhancement of viral binding and uptake is accompanied by attachment of large aggregates of virus to the neutrophil, and the binding of IAV or SP-D-IAV aggregates is abrogated by pretreatment of the phagocyte with neuraminidase . Thus, viral internalization involves enhanced binding of the virus to sialylated glycoconjugate ligands on the neutrophil surface. SP-D also potentiates IAV-induced hydrogen peroxide responses in neutrophils, and protects neutrophils from IAV-induced inhibition of respiratory burst responses. Interestingly, SP-D does not increase the uptake of IAV by rat alveolar macrophages. Thus, there might be cell type specific effects of SP-D on phagocytic cells. Notably, human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) contains sufficient concentrations of SP-D to inhibit IAV HA activity in vitro, and depletion of SP-D from BAL reduces its HA inhibitory activity .
        SP-D can also interact with other respiratory viruses. For example, natural SP-D and a recombinant trimeric SP-D bind to the Rous sarcoma virus G protein in vitro and inhibit viral infectivity in vivo . These studies suggest that CRD-dependent binding, but not aggregation, is required to mediate the antiviral effect. In addition, bovine SP-D inhibits the infectivity of rotaviruses through calcium-dependent, mannose-inhibitable, attachment to the major viral envelope glycoprotein .
      
    
    
      Interactions of SP-D with host cells
      SP-D can interact with host cells, both directly and indirectly. As indicated above, SP-D can enhance the phagocytosis and killing of certain microorganisms and enhance the oxidant response to microbial binding. However, at present there is only one study that suggests that the enhancement of phagocytosis by SP-D might involve the participation of an opsonic receptor. Furthermore, the enhanced uptake of IAV seems to be mediated by viral aggregation, with enhanced interactions of the virus with its natural receptors on the host cell.
      In any case, SP-D can interact directly with host cells, and in some cases can influence their behavior. SP-D is chemotactic and haptotactic for neutrophils and certain mononuclear phagocytes  and can elicit directional actin polymerization in alveolar macrophages . In this regard, SP-D is considerably more potent than SP-A. Early studies with natural proteins isolated from silicotic animals reported directed effects on the oxidant metabolism of isolated alveolar macrophages . However, such effects can probably be attributed to endotoxin contamination and/or aggregation. Purified dodecamers do not significantly increase the production of nitric oxide  or of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (Y Kesari, H Wang, A Mesika, E Crouch and I Ofek, unpublished data). Interestingly, purified SP-D has been reported to increase the production of several metalloproteinases in the absence of a significant effect on proinflammatory cytokine production .
      
        SP-D receptors
        Despite the ability of SP-D to modulate a variety of cellular functions, little is currently known about potential cellular receptors for this protein. The uptake of mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa is decreased when macrophages are attached to slides coated with SP-D, in comparison with lysine-coated slides, suggesting the redistribution of a membrane receptor . In addition, SP-D is internalized by phagocytic cells and can be identified within phagolysosomal compartments , but it is unclear whether the uptake is receptor dependent and whether SP-D is being internalized in association with specific ligands.
        There are at least two classes of binding to host cells: CRD-dependent and CRD-independent. Some studies have demonstrated CRD-dependent binding to phagocytes that can be inhibited with EDTA or competing saccharides, both in vitro and in vivo.
        
          CRD-dependent cell binding
          As indicated above, the ability of SP-D to elicit the chemotaxis of neutrophilic and monocytic cells depends on the lectin activity of SP-D . In addition, Kuan and coworkers reported that extracting formaldehyde-fixed alveolar macrophages with detergents largely eliminates the binding of purified SP-D, suggesting a membrane-associated ligand or glycolipid receptor . Dong and Wright have extended these findings and suggest that PI can contribute to SP-D binding by alveolar macrophages .
          It is of interest that SP-D can bind to recombinant sCD14 through interactions with N-linked oligosaccharides . Given that the membrane-associated form of CD14 is widely expressed on host cells, it is possible that CD14 can serve as a binding site on macrophages and other cell types.
          The phagocytic uptake of certain bacteria by neutrophils is also inhibited by calcium chelation or competing sugars ; however, this could result from the inhibition of microbial agglutination rather than lectin-dependent interactions with the phagocyte. Wang et al suggested that SP-D can bind to lymphocytic cells by a lectin-dependent mechanism . In this regard, it is interesting to note that glucosylceramide, a ligand for SP-D in vitro, is one of the most abundant neutral glycolipids expressed by lymphoid cells.
        
        
          CRD-independent cell binding
          Reid and co-workers were the first to present evidence for lectin-independent binding . These and other studies suggested that binding does not involve known C1q or collectin receptors. The only putative receptor protein, gp-340, is a widely expressed member of the scavenger receptor superfamily . It binds to the CRD of SP-D in a calcium-dependent manner that does not require the lectin activity of SP-D. Although the protein has been immunolocalized to alveolar macrophage membranes and distributes together with SP-D in many different human tissues , it has not yet been shown to mediate the binding of SP-D to these cells or to participate in signal transduction events. The cDNAs isolated from lung have not shown a membrane-spanning region , and the protein is abundant as a soluble component in BAL. Given that gp-340 is a highly multimerized protein that contains numerous potential ligand binding domains (Fig. 1b), it is possible that the protein cooperates with SP-D in the neutralization or clearance of certain ligands rather than specifically mediating the interactions of SP-D with host cells.
        
      
      
        Interactions with type II cells
        Wright and co-workers have demonstrated the binding of SP-D to isolated type II pneumocytes. The mechanism seems distinct from the binding to macrophages . The binding was dependent on concentration, time, and temperature and required calcium; it was not sensitive to protease treatment or to PI-phospholipase C. Although the internalized SP-D was degraded or recycled to lamellar bodies, SP-D binding did not alter the uptake of surfactant lipids.
      
    
    
      `Charging' of SP-D versus SP-D-dependent ligand aggregation: hypotheses
      SP-D has demonstrated comparatively few direct effects on the metabolism of host cells, at least in situations where self-aggregation and endotoxin contamination have been excluded. One possible explanation is that modulation of cellular function requires the prior interaction of SP-D with a ligand. This would have numerous potential physiological advantages, because the presence of `active' protein might be restricted to sites of microbial or antigenic deposition. The binding of complex, multivalent, particulate antigens to two or more CRDs could markedly alter the conformation of SP-D molecules, with respect to the spatial orientation of the arms in relation to the N-terminal crosslinking domain and/or with respect to the spatial orientation of the CRDs within a given trimeric subunit. Thus, the `charging' of SP-D with a particulate ligand could lead to local or distant conformational changes that expose `cryptic' binding sites for cellular receptors.
      There is some preliminary evidence consistent with the notion that the interaction of SP-D with a ligand alters its capacity to activate host cells. For example, Ofek et al have examined the effects of SP-D, LPS, and LPS-coated latex beads on the production of nitric oxide by alveolar macrophage-like cells (I Ofek, A Mesika, M Kalina, Y Keisari, D Chang, D McGregor and EC Crouch, manuscript submitted). Under conditions in which SP-D, LPS, latex beads, or latex beads coated with SP-D or LPS were no more than minimally stimulatory, the opsonization of LPS-coated latex beads with SP-D resulted in a marked increase in NO production (I Ofek, A Mesika, M Kalina, Y Keisari, D Chang, D McGregor and EC Crouch, manuscript submitted). Although these effects can be abrogated with competing sugars, it is unclear whether the inhibitory effect of competing sugars involves the disruption of the interaction of SP-D with the ligand, the host cell, or both. All the effects could be secondary to altered presentation of the aggregated particles to receptors for the particulate ligand on the host cell.
      Thus, it is unclear whether one needs to invoke the participation of an SP-D receptor for many of its functions. It is well established that the binding of SP-D to IAV particles leads to aggregation-dependent enhancement of viral binding to neutrophils, with an increased oxidative response . These effects involve the natural receptors for the virus on the neutrophil. Significantly, the effects on neutrophil function are blocked by enzymic destruction of the sialic acid-binding sites for the HA on the neutrophil membrane , suggesting that the effects of SP-D do not require cellular recognition of the bound protein. Aggregation might also be important for mediating the interactions of neutrophils with some bacteria .
    
    
      Lipid aggregation and surfactant homeostasis
      Particle aggregation might be particularly important for other aspects of SP-D function. The relatively large spatial separation of CRDs seems highly suited to bridging interactions between particles with resultant aggregation, as demonstrated by experiments with IAV. Particle aggregation could similarly contribute to the metabolism of certain subfractions of surfactant lipid. For example, Poulain et al have shown that SP-D can mediate the formation of characteristic tubular configurations of lipid mixtures containing PI . Similar structures have been identified in association with type II cells in culture, and in alveolar proteinosis lavage. In addition, Persson et al demonstrated the aggregation of PI-containing liposomes .
    
    
      Modulation of SP-D function
      A variety of factors can modulate the lectin activity of SP-D in vitro and might influence SP-D activity in vivo. Selected examples are listed in Table 3 and discussed below.
      
        Altered patterns of oligomerization
        SP-D can be isolated in different multimeric forms from proteinosis lavage  and are produced by Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells transfected with human SP-D cDNA . As described previously, the effects of SP-D on the neutrophil response to influenza virus are highly dependent on the ability of SP-D to agglutinate the viral particles, and the agglutination activity is directly correlated with the extent of multimerization. Trimers can bind to the virus but have little capacity to modulate neutrophil interactions. By contrast, highly multimerized proteins show greater activity than dodecamers .
        Given these observations, factors that favor enhanced oligomerization or lead to the accumulation of trimeric subunits promote might influence SP-D function. For example, the liberation of active trimers by a hypothetical microbial protease could lead to the accumulation of molecules that might inhibit the aggregation-dependent activities of SP-D. In contrast, recombinant trimeric CRDs can stimulate chemotaxis  and decrease viral infectivity . Although higher-order oligomers of SP-D can self-aggregate and precipitate in the presence of calcium in vitro, the functional consequences are not known.
      
      
        Biochemical modifications to the CRD
        The lectin activity of SP-A is decreased after the nitric oxide-dependent nitration of tyrosine residues , and nitration decreases the ability of SP-A to enhance the adherence of Pneumocystis to alveolar macrophages . However, similar findings have not yet been reported for SP-D. Conditions of mildly acidic pH, as might be found in endocytic compartments, are predicted to disrupt the lectin-dependent activities of SP-D . Proteolytic degradation remains an important possibility. However, SP-D is highly resistant to degradation by a wide variety of neutral proteases in vitro, and degradation products have not yet been shown to accumulate under pathological conditions in vivo.
      
      
        Competing ligands
        Glucose concentrations at levels encountered in diabetes can interfere with SP-D's ability to interact with specific strains of IAV or other microorganisms in vitro . Many microorganisms release cell wall polysaccharides or glycoconjugates, which might interfere with the binding of collectins to the same or other organisms. In this regard, SP-D recovered from rats after the instillation of LPS into the airway shows decreased lectin activity, which is attributed to occupancy of the CRD with LPS . It seems reasonable to speculate that some organisms might compete with other organisms for binding to SP-D. Such a situation could conceivably predispose to secondary infections. Lastly, the potential inhibitory effects of competing saccharide ligands presents important methodological considerations for experiments using carbohydrate-containing cell culture medium or buffers.
      
      
        Host lectins with overlapping specificity
        It is difficult to predict the functions of SP-D within the airspace. Other lectins with overlapping specificity are also present. Although the levels of mannose-binding lectin are probably low in the absence of increased vascular permeability, SP-A and the macrophage mannose receptor could conceivably interact with the same ligands in the distal airways and alveoli. Such interactions could lead to antagonistic or cooperative effects. Furthermore, we have little knowledge regarding the microanatomic distribution of these molecules in specific circumstances in vivo. Although most SP-A is probably associated with the insoluble phase of the alveolar lining material, and the macrophage mannose receptor is membrane-associated, the distribution might be altered in the setting of lung injury.

      In vivo models of SP-D deficiency
      Models of SP-D deficiency show no detectable anatomical or physiological abnormalities at birth. However, the animals gradually develop a patchy, subpleural alveolar lipidosis with associated type II cell hypertrophy, the accumulation of enlarged and foamy macrophages, and an apparent expansion of peribronchial lymphoid tissue . Interestingly, the mice eventually develop distal-acinar emphysema and areas of subpleural fibrosis, which could reflect a continuing inflammatory reaction associated with abnormal oxidant metabolism and metalloproteinase activity . By contrast, SP-A-deficient mice (-/-) show essentially normal respiratory function and surfactant lipid metabolism  but numerous apparent host defense abnormalities .
    
    
      SP-D: in vivo models of microbial challenge
      
        Challenge of normal mice
        The capacity of SP-D to bind to specific strains of influenza A in vitro is highly correlated with the capacity of the virus to proliferate in mice in vivo . Specifically, strains with more oligosaccharide attachments on the HA are preferentially neutralized by SP-D in vitro and show decreased proliferation in mice. Because the administration of mannan together with the virus increased the replication of IAV in the lung, the involvement of a mannose-type, C-type lectin was implicated.
        SP-D-sensitive IAV strains also replicate to higher titers in the lungs of diabetic mice than in nondiabetic controls . Replication of the virus is positively correlated with blood glucose level, and decreases in response to insulin treatment. Significantly, blood glucose levels comparable to those measured in the diabetic mice were sufficient to inhibit the interaction of SP-D with these viral strains in vitro. PR-8, a strain that does not interact with SP-D but does interact with SP-A, replicated to the same extent in diabetic and control mice.
        SP-D levels increase in association with certain infections. For example, SP-D levels, but not the levels of serum mannose-binding lectin, increase markedly after IAV infection . Impressive increases in SP-D have also been observed in murine models of Pneumocystis carinii  and P. aeruginosa infection .
      
      
        Challenge of SP-D-deficient mice
        SP-D-deficient mice have not yet been extensively characterized with respect to host defense function. However, they show decreased viral clearance and enhanced inflammation after challenge with respiratory syncytial virus  and IAV (AM Levine, personal communication). In addition, they show increased inflammation, increased oxidant production, and decreased macrophage phagocytosis in response to intratracheally instilled group B streptococcus and Haemophilus influenzae (AM Levine, personal communication). Although the overexpression of wild-type SP-D in type II pneumocytes with the SP-D-deficient mice can prevent the lipidosis and inflammatory changes , the ability of overexpressed wild-type SP-D or exogenous SP-D to ameliorate these abnormalities has not yet been described. The coexisting pulmonary abnormalities also complicate the interpretation of challenge models. For example, macrophage activation might enhance killing and offset any decrease that results more directly from SP-D deficiency. SP-D deficiency modifies the host response to instilled LPS with decreased lung injury and inflammatory cell recruitment .
      
    
    
      Possible roles of SP-D in acquired immunity
      Molecules that can bind to potential antigens and deliver them to macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells might contribute to the development of acquired immunity. In this regard, a few published observations suggest possible roles in the development of humoral and/or cellular immunity in response to microorganisms or complex organic antigens. For example, SP-D can decrease interleukin-2-dependent T-lymphocyte proliferation . Interestingly, single-arm mutants were at least as potent as intact dodecamers in mediating this effect. SP-D also binds to oligosaccharides associated with dust mite allergen , and can inhibit the binding of specific IgE to these allergens, possibly through direct, CRD-dependent binding to lymphocytes . Thus, alterations in the level of SP-D (or the state of oligomerization) might influence the development of immunological responses and contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other hypersensitivity disorders.
      There are other potential interplays between humoral immunity and collectins with regard to antimicrobial host defense. For example, increased glycosylation of IAV coat proteins, an adaptation that is believed to help the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralization, is associated with increased reactivity with SP-D and other collectins . Thus, the relative potential importance of antibody and col-lectin-mediated host defenses might be influenced by subtle variations in the structure of the microbial surface.
    
    
      SP-D gene expression
      
        Developmental regulation
        There is little recent information on the developmental regulation of SP-D expression. In general, SP-D increases rapidly late in gestation . The production of SP-D increases during the culture of fetal lung explants, and expression can be increased with glucocorticoids . The exposure of fetal rats to glucocorticoids in vivo leads to precocious expression with increased numbers of SP-D-expressing cells and increased cellular levels of SP-D message .
      
      
        Altered expression with lung injury
        Although SP-D is produced constitutively within the lung, protein accumulation and gene expression are inducible and increases in SP-D expression have been observed in a number of disease states or models (Tables 4 and 5). In general, the synthesis and secretion of SP-D increase in association with lung injury and activation of the respiratory epithelium . For example, levels of SP-D mRNA and SP-D accumulation are increased within 24-72h after intratracheal instillation of LPS , and SP-D expression by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells increases after exposure of rats to 95% O2 for 12 h . Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) increases SP-D expression and protein production in association with pneumocyte hyperplasia and after injury caused by bleomycin . In addition, the levels of SP-D can increase markedly in response to the overexpression of certain cytokines, such as interleukin-4, or in response to microbial challenge .
      
      
        Transcriptional regulation
        Studies of the upstream regulatory region of the SP-D gene have demonstrated increased promoter activity in the presence of glucocorticoids, which is consistent with the findings in vivo and in lung organ culture . However, no functional glucocorticoid response elements have been identified, and the effects of dexamethasone seem to be secondary and involve the effects of other transregulatory molecules.
        The activity of the human SP-D promoter is dependent on a conserved activator protein-1 (AP-1) element (-109) that binds to members of the fos and jun families of transcriptional factors . In addition, the promoter contains multiple functional binding sites for CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that these are required for basal and stimulated promoter activity, and promoter activity is markedly increased in H441 cells after co-transfection with C/EBPβ cDNA (YC He and E crouch, unpublished data). The importance of the conserved AP-1 element and the presence of multiple binding sites for C/EBP transcription factors is consistent with the observed modulation of SP-D expression in the setting of tissue injury.
        SP-D promoter activity is not dependent on the binding of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) . However, promoter activity is dependent on two interacting forkhead binding sites, upstream and downstream of the AP-1 element; these sites bind to hepatic nuclear factor-3α and apparently other forkhead box proteins in H441 lung adenocarcinoma nuclear extracts .

      Genetic variation
      Initial comparison of genomic and cDNA sequence suggested the existence of genetic polymorphisms in the SP-D coding sequence, including one in the N-terminal propeptide domain (Thr11 compared with Met11 in the mature protein) and three additional differences within the collagen domain at positions 102, 160, and 186 . The latter substitutions are conservative to the extent that they are not expected to disrupt the collagen helix. Floros and co-workers have recently confirmed the existence of polymorphisms at positions 11 and 160 of the mature protein . The potential biological significance, if any, is not known. Interestingly, the 50 kDa variant of SP-D showed O-linked glycosylation of Thr11 , suggesting that this polymorphism might be associated with altered glycosylation. Interestingly, the 50 kDa variant was recovered as trimeric subunits, raising the possibility that differences in the glycosylation of residue 11, which is immediately N-terminal to Cys15, could influence multimerization and the capacity of SP-D to participate in bridging interactions.
    
    
      Conclusion
      There is increasing evidence that SP-D interacts specifically with a wide variety of respiratory pathogens, modulates the leukocyte response to these organisms, and participates in aspects of pulmonary immune and inflammatory regulation (Table 6). SP-D can influence the activity of phagocytes through CRD-dependent and CRD-independent interactions. At least some of the effects of SP-D result from aggregation with enhanced binding of the agglutinated ligand to their natural `receptors'. Although the lung is the major site of SP-D expression, it is likely that the protein has more generalized roles in host defense and the acute response to infection and tissue injury.

      Introduction
      ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 are members of a peptide family that has been the subject of much interest in the past decade. Our laboratory and that of Highsmith identified this peptide vasoconstrictor secreted from endothelial cells  that was subsequently isolated, sequenced, cloned, and named by Yanagisawa in 1988 . The many diverse and overlapping functions of these peptides have since implicated endothelins in both homeostatic mechanisms as well as diseases of the lungs. This review will focus on the role of endothelins (particularly ET-1), emphasizing the need to better understand endothelin biology and function in a wide variety of disorders including diseases of the airways and pulmonary vasculature, lung tumors, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and fibrotic diseases (Table 1).

      Endothelin biochemistry
      The endothelins are a family of 21 amino acid peptides, of which there are three distinct isoforms (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3). The isoforms ET-2 and ET-3 differ from ET-1 by two and six amino acids, respectively, and share significant homology, especially at the carboxy terminus with sarafotoxins a-e (Fig. 1). Endothelin-1 is the most abundant isoform and has been best characterized. The lung has the highest levels of ET-1 secreted by endothelium, smooth muscle, airway epithelium, and a variety of other cells (Table 2). ET-1 also circulates in the plasma. In the normal lung, ET-1 mainly localizes to vascular endothelium, airway and vascular smooth muscle cells and, to a lesser degree, the epithelium. ET-2 has similar biologic functions as ET-1 and is found in the myocardium, kidney and placental tissues. ET-3 also circulates in plasma and is found in the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and kidney although the cellular source is not clear. The gene for ET-1 is located on chromosome 6, that for ET-2 on chromosome 1, and the gene for ET-3 on chromosome 20 .

      All three endothelins are synthesized as preprohormones and post-translationally processed to active peptides. ET-1 processing has been best characterized and begins with the 212 amino acid peptide (preproET-1), which is then proteolytically cleaved by endopeptidases to big ET-1 (proET-1). The 39 amino acid proET-1 has 1% of the biologic activity of ET-1, and is cleaved by the metalloendoprotease endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), resulting in the 21 amino acid protein with potent biologic functions  (Fig. 1). ECE is found in many cell types in the lung including endothelium, epithelium and alveolar macrophages . ET-1 is not stored in the cell , but is processed and transported through the cell in vesicles, resulting in directional secretion (80%) of ET-1 toward the interstitium and smooth muscle and away from the luminal surface of the airway or vessel . Directional secretion allows ET-1 to act in a paracrine or autocrine manner whereas secretion into the circulation allows ET-1 to act as a hormone.
      There are currently two distinct human endothelin receptors known, endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB) receptors, which are members of the seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled rhodopsin superfamily . The ETA and ETB receptor genes are located on chromosomes 4 and 13, respectively. ETA has a higher affinity for ET-1 and ET-2 than ET-3, but all three have equal affinity for ETB receptors. A third receptor subtype (endothelin C) with high affinity for ET-3 has been isolated and cloned from Xenopus laevis . ETA receptors in normal lung are found in greatest abundance on vascular and airway smooth muscle, whereas ETB receptors are most often found on the endothelium. Clearance of ET-1 from the circulation is mediated by the ETB receptor primarily in the lung, but also in the kidney and liver .
      Activation of both ETA and ETB receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to vasoconstriction whereas ETB receptor activation leads to bronchoconstriction. Activation of ETB receptors located on endothelial cells leads to vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. The mitogenic and inflammatory modulator functions of ET-1 are primarily mediated by ETA receptor activity. Binding of the ligand to its receptor results in coupling of cell-specific G proteins that activate or inhibit adenylate cyclase, stimulate phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phosholipase, open voltage gated calcium and potassium channels, and so on. The varied effects of ET-1 receptor activation thus depend on the G protein and signal transduction pathways active in the cell of interest . A growing number of receptor antagonists exist with variable selectivity for one or both receptor subtypes.
      Regulation of ET-1 is at the level of transcription, with stimuli including shear stress, hypoxia, cytokines (IL-2, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, IFN-β, etc), lipopolysaccharides, and many growth factors (transforming growth factor β, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, etc) inducing transcription of ET-1 mRNA and secretion of protein . ET-1 acting in an autocrine fashion may also increase ET-1 expression . ET-1 expression is decreased by NO . Some stimuli may additionally enhance preproET-1 mRNA stability, leading to increased and sustained ET-1 expression. The number of ETA and ETB receptors is also cell specific and regulated by a variety of growth factors . Because ET-1 and receptor expression is influenced by many diverse physical and biochemical mechanisms, the role of ET-1 in pathologic states has been difficult to define, and these are addressed in subsequent parts of this article.
    
    
      Airway diseases
      In the airway, ET-1 is localized primarily to the bronchial smooth muscle with low expression in the epithelium. Cellular subsets of the epithelium that secrete ET-1 include mucous cells, serous cells, and Clara cells . ET binding sites are found on bronchial smooth muscle, alveolar septae, endothelial cells, and parasympathetic ganglia . ET-1 expression in the airways, as previously noted, is regulated by inflammatory mediators. Eosinophilic airway inflammation, as may be seen in severe asthma, is associated with increased ET-1 levels in the lung . ET-1 secretion may also act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, via the ETA receptor, leading to increased transepithelial potential difference and ciliary beat frequency, and to exerting mitogenic effects on airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells .
      All three endothelins cause bronchoconstriction in intact airways, with ET-1 being the most potent. Denuded bronchi constrict equally to all three endothelins, suggesting considerable modulation of ET-1 effects by the epithelium . The vast majority of ET-1 binding sites on bronchial smooth muscle are ETB receptors, and bronchoconstriction in human bronchi is not inhibited by ETA antagonists but augmented by ETB receptor agonists . Since cultured airway epithelium secretes equal amounts of ET-1 and ET-3, which have equivalent affinity for the ETB receptor, bronchoconstriction could be mediated by both endothelins .
      While ET-1 stimulates release of multiple cytokines important in airway inflammation, it does not enhance secretion of histamine or leukotrienes. ET-1 does increase prostaglandin release . Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, however, has no effect on bronchoconstriction suggesting that, despite the release of multiple mediators, ET-1 mediated bronchoconstriction is a direct effect of activation of the ETB receptor . ETA mediated bronchoconstriction may also be important following ETB receptor desensitization or denudation of the airway epithelium, as may occur during airway inflammation and during the late, sustained airway response to inhaled antigens . Interestingly, heterozygous ET-1 knockout mice, with a 50% reduction in ET-1 peptide, have airway hyperresponsiveness but not remodeling, suggesting the decrease in ET-1 modulates bronchoconstriction activity by a functional mechanism, possibly by decreasing basal NO production .
      Asthma is also an inflammatory airway disease characterized by bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity with influx of inflammatory cells, mucus production, edema, and airway thickening. ET-1 may have important roles in each of these processes. While ET-1 causes immediate bronchoconstriction , it also increases bronchial reactivity to inhaled antigens  as well as influx of inflammatory cells , increased cytokine production , airway edema , and airway remodeling . Airway inflammation also leads to increased ET-1 synthesis, possibly perpetuating the inflammation and bronchoconstriction . ET-1 release from cultured peripheral mononuclear and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics is also increased . Inhibition of ETA or combined ETA and ETB receptors additionally leads to decreased airway inflammation in antigen-challenged animals, suggesting that the proinflammatory effects of ET-1 in the airway are mediated by ETA receptors .
      Children with asthma have increased circulating levels of ET-1 . Adult asthmatics have normal levels between attacks but, during acute attacks, have elevated serum ET-1 levels that correlate inversely with airflow measurements and decrease with treatment . Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ET-1 in asthmatics is similarly increased to concentrations that cause bronchoconstriction and inversely correlates with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) . As in cultured epithelial cells, ET-1 and ET-3 are found in equal amounts in BAL fluid from asthmatics . There is also a relative increase in ETB versus ETA receptor expression in asthmatic patients, which may contribute to increased bronchoconstriction . Not all asthmatics, however, have increased ET-1 as patients with nocturnal asthma have decreased BAL ET-1 levels . Treatment of acute asthma exacerbations with steroids, beta-adrenergic agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors resulted in decreased BAL ET-1 . Immunostaining and in situ hybridization for ET-1 in biopsy specimens from asthmatics have shown an increase in ET-1 in the bronchial epithelium that correlates with asthma symptoms .
      Cigarette smoking leads to increased circulating ET-1  but patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia, do not have increased plasma ET-1 . Increases in urinary ET-1 instead correlate with decreases in oxygenation, possibly through hypoxic release of ET-1 from the kidney . Smokers also have impaired ET-1 mediated vasodilation that correlates with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and may contribute to pulmonary hypertension .
      ET-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis by its ability to promote neutrophil chemotaxis, adherence, and activation . Sputum ET-1 levels are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis , and sputum ET-1 correlated with Pseduomonas infection in noncystic fibrosis related bronchiectasis .
      ET-1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), which is characterized by injury to small conducting airways resulting in formation of proliferative, collagen rich tissue obliterating airway architecture. BO is the leading cause of late mortality from lung transplantation, and ET-1 is increased in lung allografts . The pro-inflammatory and mitogenic properties of ET-1 in the airways has led to speculation that ET-1 may be involved in formation of the lesion . This is further supported by the increase in BAL ET-1 in lung allografts . The in vivo gene transfer of ET-1 to the airway epithelium using the hemagglutinating virus of Japan in rats recently resulted in pathologic changes in the distal airways identical to those seen in human BO specimens . These changes were not due to nonspecific effects of the hemagglutinating virus of Japan itself, but could be attributed to the presence of the ET-1 gene, which was localized to the airway epithelium, hyperplastic lesions, and alveolar cells.
    
    
      Pulmonary vascular disease
      Pulmonary hypertension is a rare and progressive disease characterized by increases in normally low pulmonary vascular tone, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and progressive right heart failure. ET-1 has been implicated as a mediator in the changes seen in pulmonary hypertension. In the pulmonary vasculature, ET-1 is found primarily in endothelial cells and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle cells. The endothelium secretes ET-1 primarily to the basolateral surface of the cell. ET-1 secretion may be increased by a variety of stimuli including cytokines, catecholamines, and physical forces such as shear stress, and decreased by NO, prostaglandins, and oxidant stress . Hypoxia has been reported to increase, have no effect, or decrease ET-1 release from endothelial cells .
      Activation of the receptors for ET-1 in the pulmonary vasculature leads to both vasodilation and vasoconstriction, and depends on both cell type and receptor. In the whole lung, ETA receptors are the most abundant and are localized to the medial layer of the arteries, decreasing in intensity in the peripheral circulation . ETB receptors are also found in the media of the pulmonary vessels, increasing in intensity in the distal circulation, while intimal ETB receptors are localized in the larger elastic arteries . This distribution of receptors has important implications in understanding ET-1 regulation of vascular tone. Vascular ET-1 receptors may be increased by several factors including angiotensin and hypoxia .
      ET-1 can act as both a vasodilator and vasoconstrictor in the pulmonary circulation. Generation of NO or opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels leading to hyperpolarization results in vasodilation mediated by ETB receptors on pulmonary endothelium . In hypertensive, chronically hypoxic lungs with increased ETB receptor expression, augmented vasodilation is due to increased ETB mediated NO release that is inhibited by hypoxic ventilation, while inhibition of NO synthesis leads to increased ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction . Both ETA and ETB receptors, conversely, acting on vascular smooth muscle, mediate ET-1 induced vasoconstriction. In the normal lung, ET-1 causes vasoconstriction primarily by activation of the ETA receptors in the large, conducting vessels of the lung . In the smaller, resistance vessels of the lung, ETB receptors in the media predominate and are responsible for the ET-1 induced vasoconstriction . Interestingly, preconstriction of the pulmonary circulation resulted in a shift from primarily ETA mediated to ETB mediated vasoconstriction .
      The overall effect of ET-1 on vascular tone depends on both the dose and on the pre-existing tone in the lung. ET-1 administration during acute hypoxic vasoconstriction will result in transient pulmonary vasodilation . This effect is dose dependent, with lower doses leading to vasodilation while higher or repetitive doses cause vasoconstriction following an initial, brief vasodilation . The role of ET-1 in the acute hypoxic vasoconstriction in the lung is not certain. ETA receptor antagonism attenuates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in several species , and ET-1 may be implicated in the mechanism of acute hypoxic response by inhibition of K-ATP channels .
      Several lines of evidence have suggested the importance of ET-1 in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. ET-1 is increased in plasma and lungs of rats following exposure to hypoxia . Treatment with either ETA or combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonists additionally attenuates the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension . ET-1 has also been implicated in the vascular remodeling associated with chronic hypoxia through its mitogenic effects on vascular smooth muscle cells .
      ET-1 has also been implicated in other animal models of pulmonary hypertension. ET-1 is increased in fawn hooded rats that develop severe pulmonary hypertension when raised under conditions of mild hypoxia and in monocrotaline treated rats . The increase in ET-1 in both of these forms of pulmonary hypertension may be contributing to increases in vascular tone as well as in vascular remodeling . Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing the human preproET-1 gene, with modestly increased lung ET-1 levels (35-50%), do not develop pulmonary hypertension under normoxic conditions or an exaggerated response to chronic hypoxia .
      Human pulmonary hypertension is classified as primary, or unexplained, or secondary to other cardiopulmonary diseases or connective tissue diseases (ie scleroderma). Hallmarks of the disease include progressive increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular remodeling, with thickening of the medial layer small pulmonary arterioles and formation of the complex plexiform lesion . Circulating ET-1 is increased in humans with pulmonary hypertension, either primary or due to other cardiopulmonary disease . Levels are highest in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. Since the lung is the major source for clearance of ET-1 from the circulation, increased arterio-venous ratios as seen in primary pulmonary hypertension suggest either decreased clearance or increased production in the lung . ET-1 is also increased in lungs of patients with pulmonary hypertension, with the greatest increase seen in the small resistance arteries and the plexiform lesions , and may correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance . Interestingly, treatment with continuous infusion of prostacyclin resulted in clinical improvement and a decrease in the arterio-venous ratio of ET-1 , possibly by decreasing ET-1 synthesis from endothelial cells . Studies using ET-1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension are underway and may offer hope to patients with this disease by inhibiting this pluripotent peptide's effects on vascular tone and remodeling.
    
    
      Lung transplantation and rejection
      Several lines of evidence suggest the importance of ET-1 in lung allograft survival and rejection. The peptide has been implicated as an important factor in ischemia-reperfusion injury at the time of transplant as well as in acute and chronic rejection of the allograft.
      Circulating ET-1 is increased in humans undergoing lung transplant immediately following perfusion of the allograft. Plasma ET-1 increased threefold within minutes, remained high for 12 hours following transplantation, and declined to near normal levels within 24 hours . This increase in ET-1 correlated with the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurring about 6 hours post-transplantation, suggesting that the release of ET-1 in the circulation may have mediated this event. ET-1 in BAL fluid from recipients of lung allografts is similarly increased several fold and remains elevated up to 2 years post-transplant . In recipients of single lung transplants, ET-1 was increased 10-fold in BAL fluid from the transplanted lung compared with the native lung, suggesting that the increase in ET-1 was due to the graft and not the underlying disease requiring transplant . ET-1 in BAL fluid did not, however, correlate with episodes of infection or rejection.
      The cellular source of ET-1 in lung allografts is unknown. The expression of ET-1 in nontransplanted human lungs is low and found primarily in the vascular endothelium . Transbronchial biopsy specimens obtained either for surveillance or for clinical suspicion of infection or rejection following transplantation revealed the presence of ET-1 in the airway epithelium and in alveolar macrophages . ET-1 was occasionally seen in lymphocytes but not in the endothelium or pneumocytes. ET-1 localization was no different in surveillance specimens compared with infected or rejecting lungs, or changed over time from transplantation. This study suggests that the source of the increased BAL ET-1 in transplanted lungs is due to the increased number of alveolar inflammatory cells and de novo expression in the airway epithelium. The biologic importance of the ET-1 from inflammatory cells is supported by the observation that peripheral mononuclear cells from dogs with mild to moderate lung allograft rejection cause vasoconstriction in pulmonary arterial rings, which is attenuated by the ETA blocker BQ123 .
      Analysis of ET-1 binding activity in failed transplanted human lungs suggested that ET-1 binding activity was not different compared with normal lung in the lung parenchyma, bronchial smooth muscle, or perivascular infiltrates. ET-1 binding was, however, decreased in small muscular arteries (pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries) in the failed transplants, suggesting a role for ET-1 in impaired vasoregulation of transplanted lungs .
      Ischemia-reperfusion injury is the leading cause of early post-operative graft failure and death. In its severest manifestation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema lead to cor pulmonale and death . ET-1 has been implicated as a mediator of these events. The increase in pulmonary vascular resistance observed in human recipients of lung allografts follows an increase in circulating ET-1 and falls with decreases in circulating ET-1 . A similar pattern is seen in dogs subjected to allotransplantation . Conscious dogs with left pulmonary allografts demonstrate an increase in both resting pulmonary perfusion pressure and acute pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to hypoxia . Administration of ETA selective or combined ETA and ETB receptor blockers did not change the resting tone. ETB receptor mediated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction appeared, however, to be increased in allograft recipients. In another study, administration of a mixed ETA and ETB receptor antagonist (SB209670) to dogs before reperfusion of the allograft resulted in a marked increase in oxygenation, decreases in pulmonary arterial pressures and improved survival compared with control animals . In a model of ischemia reperfusion, inhibitors of ECE additionally attenuated the increase in circulating ET-1 and the severity of lung injury . ET-1 receptor antagonists did not, however, completely eliminate the ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting that changes in other vasoactive mediators, such as an increase in thromboxane, a decrease in prostaglandins, or a decrease in NO, may also contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Administration of NO donor (FK409) to both donor and recipient dogs before lung transplantation reduced pulmonary arterial pressure, lung edema, and inflammation, and improved survival. This suggests that reductions in NO following transplantation may be partly responsible for early graft failure . Treatment with NO donor was also associated with a decrease in plasma ET-1 levels.
      Acute rejection is manifested by diffuse infiltrates, hypoxia, and airflow limitation, and may lead to respiratory insufficiency and death. BAL ET-1 was increased in dogs during episodes of acute rejection that decreased with immunosuppressive treatment . Acute episodes of rejection in humans, however, are not associated with further increases in BAL ET-1 . Chronic rejection of allografts, manifested as BO, is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in long-term lung transplant survivors . The etiology of BO following transplant is unclear but may be related to repeated episodes of acute rejection, chronic low-grade rejection, or organizing pneumonia . As discussed earlier, a chronic increase in ET-1, as seen in lung allografts, may contribute to bronchospasm and proliferative bronchiolitis obliterans due to the bronchoconstrictor and smooth muscle mitogenic effects of ET-1 . This is further supported by the increase of BAL ET-1 in the transplanted lung, which is susceptible to BO, but not the native lung in recipients of single lung transplants .
    
    
      Pulmonary malignancies
      The mitogenic effects of ET-1 may play a role in the development of pulmonary malignancy as well as metastasis to the lung. Many human tumor cell lines, including prostate, breast, gastric, ovary, colon, etc, produce ET-1. The importance of the ET-1 may lie in its mitogenic effects on tumor growth and survival. This has been suggested by blockade of ETA receptors resulting in a decrease in mitogenic effects of ET-1 in a prostate cancer and colorectal cell lines . ET-1 receptors in tumor cells may also be altered with increases in the ETA receptor and downregulation of ETB receptors . Other tumors may have an increase in ETB receptors, however, and blockade of ETB results in a decrease in tumor growth . Tumor cells may, as a result of this altered balance, lose the ability to respond to regulatory signals from their environment. ET-1 may additionally protect against Fas-ligand mediated apoptosis .
      ET-1 has been detected using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in pulmonary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell tumors and, to a lesser extent, small cell and carcinoid tumors . In situ hybridization also demonstrated a similar pattern of ET-1 mRNA expression in non-neuroendocrine tumors. ET-1 receptors have also been found in a variety of pulmonary tumor cell lines. ETA receptors were found in small cell tumors, adenocarcinomas and large cell tumors, while ETB receptors were expressed primarily in adenocarcinomas and small cell tumors . ECE, which converts big ET-1 to ET-1, the committed step in ET-1 biosynthesis, was also found in human lung tumors but not in adjacent normal lung . These findings, combined with the presence of ET-1 in lung tumors, suggest a possible autocrine loop that sustains and supports the growth of lung tumors. A recent study, however, suggested that, while ETA and ECE-1 were detectable in lung tumors, these genes were downregulated compared with normal bronchial epithelial cell lines . It was proposed that the role of ET-1 in lung tumors is not that of an autocrine factor, but that of a paracrine growth factor to the stroma and vasculature surrounding the tumor allowing angiogenesis.
      Tumor angiogenesis is necessary for continued growth of the tumor beyond the limits of oxygen diffusion. The growth of vessels into the tumor is also important to metastatic potential of the tumor. ET-1 may play an important role in angiogenesis and tumor growth and survival through induction of vascular endothelial growth factor expression and sprouting of new vessels into the tumor and surrounding tissue . ET-1 binding activity was found in blood vessels and vascular stroma surrounding lung tumors at the time of resection, most markedly surrounding squamous cell tumors . ET-1 production may be further augmented by the hypoxic environment found within large solid tumors . Since metastasis is dependent on neovascularization, ET-1 may also be an important mediator of this phenomenon. ET-1 receptor antagonists may have a useful role in the treatment of neoplastic disease by inhibiting growth as well as metastatic potential of human tumors.
    
    
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome
      Experimental lung injury of many different types results in increased circulating ET-1, BAL ET-1, and lung tissue ET-1 . ET-1 levels in humans are also increased in sepsis, burns, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . ET-1 increases also correlate with a poorer outcome with multiple organ failure, increased pulmonary arterial pressure, increased airway pressure and decreased PiO2/FiO2, while clinical improvement correlates with decreased ET-1 levels . The arterio-venous ratio for ET-1 is increased in patients with ARDS but it is not clear whether this is due to increased secretion of ET-1 in the lungs or decreased clearance . In patients who succumbed to ARDS, there was also a marked increase in tissue ET-1 immunostaining in vascular endothelium, alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle, and airway epithelium compared with lungs of patients who died without ARDS. Interestingly, these same patients also had a decrease in immunostaining for both endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lung .
      ARDS is also characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the lung. Since ET-1 may act as an immune modulator, an increase in ET-1 may contribute to lung injury by inducing expression of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and IL-6 and IL-8 . These cytokines may in turn stimulate the production of many inflammatory mediators, leading to lung injury. ET-1 additionally activated neutrophils, and increased neutrophil migration and trapping in the lung .
      Another hallmark of ARDS is disruption and dysfunction of the pulmonary vascular endothelium leading to accumulation of lung water. The role of endothelin in formation of pulmonary edema is uncertain. Infusion of ET-1 raises pulmonary vascular pressure, but it is uncertain whether ET-1 by itself increased pulmonary protein or fluid transport in the lung . ET-1 may rather be acting synergistically with other mediators to lead to pulmonary edema .
    
    
      Pulmonary fibrosis
      Pulmonary fibrosis is the final outcome for a variety of injurious processes involving the lung parenchyma. The final common pathway in response to injury to the alveolar wall involves recruitment of inflammatory cells, release of inflammatory mediators, and resolution. The reparative phase occasionally becomes disordered, resulting in progressive fibrosis.
      ET-1 in the lung may be important in the initial events in lung injury by activating neutrophils to aggregate and release elastase and oxygen radicals, increasing neutrophil adherence, activating mast cells, and inducing cytokine production from monocytes . Among the many cytokines induced by ET-1 that are important in mediating pulmonary fibrosis are transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor α . ET-1 is also profibrotic by stimulating fibroblast replication, migration, contraction, and collagen synthesis and secretion while decreasing collagen degradation . ET-1 additionally enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into contractile myelofibroblasts . ET-1 also increases fibronectin production by bronchial epithelial cells . Finally, ET-1 has mitogenic effects on vascular and airway smooth muscle . ET-1 may thus play an important role in the initial injury and eventual fibrotic reparative process of many inflammatory events in the lung.
      Several lines of evidence regarding the importance of ET-1 in pulmonary fibrosis are available. Plasma and BAL ET-1 levels are increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Lung biopsies from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have additionally increased ET-1 immunostaining in airway epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, which correlates with disease activity . Scleroderma is commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Plasma and BAL ET-1 is increased in these patients , but it is unclear whether the presence of either pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis increases these levels further . BAL fluid from patients with scleroderma increased proliferation of cultured lung fibroblasts, which was inhibited by ETA receptor antagonist. This suggests that the ET-1 in the airspace may be contributing significantly to the fibrotic response . An increase in ET-1 binding has also been reported in lung tissue from patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary fibrosis . Pulmonary inflammatory cells also appear to be primed for ET-1 production because cultured alveolar macrophages from patients with scleroderma and lung involvement secrete increased amounts of ET-1 in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide . These observations collectively suggest that augmented ET-1 release may contribute to and perpetuate the inflammatory process.
      Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animals is associated with increased ET-1 expression in alveolar macrophages and epithelium . The increase in ET-1 proceeds the development of pulmonary fibrosis. The use of ET-1 receptor antagonists has produced mixed results in limiting the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. A decrease in fibroblast replication and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro but not a decrease in lung collagen content in vivo has been shown using ETA or combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonists after bleomycin . Another group did, however, observe a decrease in fibrotic area in lungs of rats following bleomycin that were treated with a mixed ETA and ETB receptor antagonist .
      While ET-1 seems to correlate with pulmonary fibrosis, it remains uncertain whether the increase in ET-1 is a cause or consequence of the lung disease. Pulmonary fibrosis was recently reported in mice that constitutively overexpress human ET-1 . These mice were known to develop progressive nephrosclerosis in the absence of systemic hypertension . The transgene was localized throughout the lung, with the strongest expression in the bronchial wall. In the lung, the mice developed age-dependent accumulation of collagen and accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes in the perivascular space. This observation suggests that an increase in lung ET-1 alone may play a causative role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis .
    
    
      Conclusion
      Since its discovery 12 years ago, much evidence has accumulated regarding the biologic activity and potential role of ET-1 in a variety of diseases of the respiratory track. As compelling as much of this evidence is, the causal relationship between ET-1 activity and disease is not complete. The increasing use of ECE and endothelin receptor antagonists in experimental and human respiratory disorders will help to clarify the role of this pluripotent peptide in health and disease.

      Introduction
      RSV and PVM are viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus; they are enveloped, single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA viruses that can cause intense viral bronchiolitis in humans and mice, respectively. In its most severe form, the lower respiratory tract infection caused by pneumoviruses is associated with the development of peribronchiolar infiltrates that are accompanied by submucosal edema and bronchorrhea, and ultimately leads to bronchiolar obstruction and compromised oxygen transfer. As the infection is confined to the respiratory epithelium, the responses of these cells are clearly of primary importance in determining the nature and extent of the resulting inflammatory process.
      Most of our understanding of responses to pneumovirus infection has emerged from studies of RSV infection of human epithelial target cells in vitro; a list of genes and/or gene products produced by epithelial cells in response to RSV infection in vitro is provided in Table 1. At the cellular level, epithelial cells initially respond to RSV infection by reducing their ciliary beat frequency. Production and release of chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) can be observed as early as 12 h after infection, leading to the recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets to the lung tissue. RSV-infected epithelial cells become resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced apoptosis, but later fuse to form giant-cell syncytia and die by cellular necrosis. We review the molecular bases (to the extent that they are understood) of these specific responses, and discuss several novel strategies that may permit us to study the responses to RSV and PVM infection in a more coherent and systematic manner.

      Ciliostasis
      Tristram et al  observed that explanted respiratory epithelial cells slow their ciliary beat frequency almost immediately after exposure to RSV, with complete ciliostasis seen as early as 6 h after the initial infection. The molecular basis of ciliostasis remains completely unknown.
    
    
      Production and release of chemokines
      The chemokines and cytokines with production and release that has been associated with RSV infection of human epithelial cells are listed in Table 1. Much of this work was also recently reviewed elsewhere . We focus here on the three chemokines whose molecular mechanisms and physiologic implications are best understood.
      
        Interleukin-8
        The earliest reports on this subject described production of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 from tissue culture supernatants from RSV-infected cells  and in nasal secretions from patients with viral rhinitis . IL-8 has since been detected in lower airway secretions from patients with severe RSV bronchiolitis , and the neutrophil influx observed in response to this infection is probably due, at least in part, to the activity of this chemokine.
        At the cellular level IL-8 production can be observed in response to inactivated RSV virions, whereas IL-8 production in response to active infection was inhibited by ribavarin, amiloride, and antioxidants . Several groups have demonstrated activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in response to RSV infection, and NF-κB is recognized for its central role in eliciting the production of IL-8 . The transcription factor NF-IL-6 is also produced in response to RSV infection , and participates in a co-operative manner with NF-κB in the regulation of IL-8 gene expression , although later studies suggest that activator protein-1 may function preferentially in this role . Interestingly, the NF-κB regulator IκBα, which functions by inhibiting NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α, was produced with different kinetics and does not promote a reversal of NF-κB activation in response to RSV infection as it does in response to TNF-α . Most recently, Casola et al  demonstrated that the IL-8 promoter contains independent response elements, with nucleotides –162 to –132 representing a unique RSV response element that is distinct from elements necessary for IL-8 production in response to TNF-α. This concept of a stimulus-specific response will probably make an important contribution toward our understanding of how pneumoviruses promote transcription of unique and specific sets of independent gene products.
      
      
        Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted
        The pleiotropic chemokine regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) has also been detected in supernatants from RSV-infected epithelial cells in culture , as well as in upper and lower airway secretions from patients infected with this virus . RANTES acts as a chemoattractant for eosinophils and monocytes in vitro, although its role in vivo is somewhat less clear. Similar to IL-8, RANTES can be produced in vitro in response to inactivated virions , and involves NF-κB activation, binding, and nuclear translocation . However, Koga et al  demonstrated that stabilization of RANTES mRNA, a response to RSV infection mediated in part by nucleotides 11–389 of the RANTES gene, is probably the primary mechanism underlying increased production and secretion of RANTES protein. Further studies will determine whether a similar mechanism is also in place for IL-8 and other RSV-mediated responses.
      
      
        Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α
        Several groups have recently shown that macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α is released from RSV-infected cells in culture ; MIP-1α was also detected in upper and lower airway secretions from RSV-infected patients . Interestingly, of the three aforementioned chemokines, MIP-1α is the one that is most closely correlated with the presence of eosinophil degranulation products; this, together with data from our PVM model of pneumovirus infection , has suggested to us that MIP-1α plays a pivotal role in eosinophil recruitment in response to primary pneumovirus infection. Interestingly, production of MIP-1α in cell culture requires active viral replication , which suggests that this response may proceed by a mechanism that is completely distinct from that which elicits production of RANTES and IL-8. However, no reports to date have addressed the molecular mechanism that underlies the RSV-mediated MIP-1α response.
      
    
    
      Cell-surface adhesion molecules
      A list of cell-surface molecules that have been reported as expressed in response to RSV infection is shown in Table 1. We focus here on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (CD54) and the leukocyte integrin CD18.
      
        Intercellular adhesion molecule-1
        Increased expression of this cell-surface adhesion protein was observed in both respiratory epithelial cell lines  and in human nasal epithelial cells  in response to infection with RSV in vitro. Chini et al  demonstrated that the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA, similar to IL-8 and RANTES, was dependent on an intact NF-κB site in the gene promoter, and demonstrated a role for the consensus binding site for the factor CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein. Stark et al  demonstrated that ICAM-1 and CD18 expressed in response to RSV serve to enhance neutrophil and eosinophil binding to epithelial cells.
      
      
        CD18
        CD18 is a polypeptide of the integrin family that functions in mediating cell–cell interactions. Several groups have observed expression of CD18 on epithelial cells in response to RSV infection , with CD18 shown to enhance the degranulation of eosinophils in this specific setting . Of particular interest are the recent findings relating expression of CD18 (along with CD14) to earlier literature on bacterial superinfections in the setting of viral infections. Earlier studies  reported enhanced binding of bacteria to respiratory epithelial cells that were infected with RSV, findings that had clinical implications relating to acute bacterial otitis media in infants.
        Two more recent studies addressed the question of binding sites. Saadi et al  determined that two strains of the pathogen Bordetella pertussis bound more efficiently to RSV-infected cells, and that the binding was reduced upon pretreatment of the cells with anti-CD14 or anti-CD18 antibodies. Similarly, Raza et al  reported that both CD14 and CD18 on RSV-infected epithelial cells contributed to the binding of nonpilate Neisseria meningitidis. In vivo testing is required before the clinical significance of these intriguing findings can be appreciated.
      
    
    
      Protection from programmed cell death
      RSV-infected epithelial cells in culture do not show features that are suggestive of apoptosis (ie no evidence of membrane blebbing, fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, or characteristic changes in nuclear morphology). Takeuchi et al  showed that, although RSV-infected epithelial cells express a number of apoptosis-associated genes, including interferon regulatory factor-1, IL-1β-converting enzyme and caspase 3, they do not undergo formal apoptosis.
      As part of our attempts to understand mucosal responses in a more systematic manner (see below), we discovered that RSV-infected epithelial cells express the recently described antiapoptosis gene IEX-1L . In our studies, we found that expression of IEX-1L is a response to active virus; no gene expression was observed in response to irradiated, replication-incompetent virus. Moreover, expression of IEX-1L is not observed in response to adenoviral infection, suggesting that expression of this gene is not a universal response to cellular perturbation, or indeed to all viral infections. Functionally, we also demonstrated that RSV infection protects epithelial cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis, an effect that is temporally associated with the expression of IEX-1L.
      Apoptosis is generally considered to be a highly efficient self-defense mechanism employed by host target cells, because it permits the infected host to dispose of viral proteins and nucleic acids on a single-cell basis without inducing an inflammatory response. It is thus not surprising that many viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent this response. Of interest, Krilov et al  demonstrated that monocytes and cord blood mononuclear cells are similarly protected from apoptosis when infected with RSV.
      Although virus-induced protection from apoptosis appears advantageous to the virus alone, another interpretation may be considered. Because respiratory epithelial cells are now recognized as a major source of leukocyte chemoattractants, and because leukocyte recruitment to the lung has been associated with enhanced viral clearance and prolonged survival in pneumovirus infection , the ability to maintain chemoattractant production from viable cells may ultimately benefit the host organism as well.
    
    
      Syncytia formation
      In tissue culture, RSV-infection is characterized by the formation of giant-cell syncytia. The mechanisms for the formation of these fused masses of cells depend in part on the expression of the RSV-specific fusion (F) protein on the surface of infected host cells, and in part on virus-mediated changes in cytoskeletal architecture. It is important to note that RSV-induced changes in cytoskeletal architecture are not restricted to cell lines grown in vitro, as giant-cell syncytia have also been found in pathologic lung specimens obtained from both humans and animals that were infected with RSV.
      Again, as part of our systematic study of gene expression in response to pneumovirus infection, we found that human respiratory epithelial cells respond to RSV infection with increased expression of the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 . Cytokeratin-17 is a 46-kDa cytoskeletal protein that belongs to the class I acidic cytokeratin family. In the lung, expression of cytokeratin-17 is normally restricted to basal epithelial cells of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. In RSV-infected cells, we found expression of Ck-17 predominantly at sites of syncytia formation, and thus provided the first description of a unique component of these pathognomonic structures at the molecular level. Similar to what has been reported for the production of IL-8, expression of Ck-17 is dependent on the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB, and future studies will determine the role of the NF-κB consensus site (–200 to –208 of the cytokeratin-17 promoter) in mediating this response.
    
    
      A novel model of inflammatory viral bronchiolitis: pneumonia virus of mice
      To date, efforts to study pneumovirus-induced alterations in gene expression have relied heavily on in vitro models of virus-infected cells and cell lines. The intrinsic value of characterizing the genes identified in this artificial system is by definition limited, and the clinical and physiologic significance of any findings must ultimately be tested in vivo. To some extent, the study of gene products in clinical specimens is possible, but this approach is limited, cumbersome, and dictated by sample availability. It is clear that an appropriate animal model of inflammatory bronchiolitis is required to characterize the alterations in gene expression discovered using the available in vitro models. Although RSV has been used for the study of specific allergic reactions to viral antigens, it is not a natural pathogen of mice, and intranasal inoculation of virus at high titer results in, at best, a minimal primary infection with a correspondingly minimal inflammatory response. In order to study gene expression in response to primary pneumovirus infection in vivo, we developed a novel mouse model of inflammatory bronchiolitis using the natural rodent pneumovirus pathogen and closest phylogenetic relative of RSV  — PVM. We presented our initial findings on PVM infection in mice in three recent publications . A summary of these findings is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 1.

      To begin, we described the cellular and biochemical pathology observed in response to PVM infection in mice . We found that infection could be established with as few as 30 plaque-forming units (pfu) of PVM in the inoculum, with infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, and viral recoveries in the order of 108 pfu/g lung tissue. We also noted inflammatory bronchiolitis as among the immediate responses to this infection, with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid containing virtually 100% neutrophils and eosinophils obtained as early as 3 days after inoculation. Furthermore, we found that infection was accompanied by the production of the proinflammatory chemokine MIP-1α, which was previously shown by Cook et al  to be an important component of the inflammatory response to the orthomyxovirus influenza virus.
      We also described the role played by MIP-1α in the pathogenesis of PVM-induced bronchiolitis . Specifically, we explored the responses of gene-deleted mice to infection with PVM, and found no inflammatory response in mice deficient in MIP-1α expression (MIP-1α-/-) and only minimal virus-induced inflammation in mice that lacked the major MIP-1α receptor on granulocytes chemokine receptor (CCR)1 (CCR1-/-). Although the inflammatory response is often considered to be unnecessary and indeed detrimental, we demonstrated that the absence of granulocytic inflammation was associated with enhanced recovery of infectious virions, as well as with accelerated mortality. These results suggest that the MIP-1α/CCR1-mediated acute inflammatory response protects mice by delaying the lethal sequelae of viral infection.
      Our most recent report on this subject  presents a direct comparison between the responses of mice to challenge with PVM and RSV. Although RSV is not a natural pathogen of mice, it has been used extensively in mouse models of human infection because a limited, or 'semipermissive' infection can be established via intranasal inoculation of virus at very high titers. In this regard, we found (as have others) that RSV infection did not result in any measurable degree of morbidity, and that viral recovery was significantly lower than that found in the inoculum; these results suggested that there was no significant viral replication in mouse lung tissue. We further demonstrated that the inflammatory response to RSV challenge was minimal, as few leukocytes were recruited to the lungs (Fig. 1).
      Taken together, our results suggest that infection of mice with PVM provides a superior model for the study of acute inflammatory bronchiolitis in response to pneumovirus infection in vivo. The advantages of this model include the following: clinical parameters — morbidity and mortality — that can be measured clearly and specifically; clear evidence of viral replication in lung tissue, with incremental recoveries that, at peak, are in excess of 108 pfu/g in response to as few as 30 pfu in the inoculum; and a dramatic granulocytic response that is modulated at least in part by the proinflammatory chemokine MIP-1α and its receptor CCR1.
    
    
      Genomic approaches to alterations in gene expression
      Traditionally, analysis of gene expression through measurement of steady-state levels of individual mRNAs could be conducted only one gene at a time using northern blotting, dot blots, or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Differential display, serial analysis of gene expression, and total gene analysis offer great promise, because they are multiplex technologies that provide simultaneous analysis of multiple mRNAs isolated under conditions of interest via PCR amplification techniques. DNA hybridization arrays are theoretically the most efficient of the gene expression analysis techniques. Although many skeptics have described these genome-based approaches as expensive, nonhypothesis-driven 'fishing expeditions', we view them as broad-based screening techniques that will enable us to identify patterns of gene expression that can then be subjected to careful characterization and analysis.
      
        Differential display
        Differential display is a semiquantitative, reverse transcription-PCR-based technique that is used to compare mRNAs from two or more conditions of interest. Both increased and decreased expression of specific amplicons will be evident — an obvious advantage to this approach. Total RNA can be isolated from virus infected versus uninfected cells or mouse lungs both before and during infection, and differential display is performed using degenerate T11(XY) anchoring primers and random upstream oligomers, as described elsewhere . The resulting PCR products are separated by electrophoresis, and the gel is dried and exposed to film. An example of our results comparing cDNA amplicons from RNA extracted from RSV-infected epithelial cells daily for 4 days is shown in Fig. 2. Differentially expressed bands are cut from the gel, eluted and reamplified using the same primers that generated the original signal, and northern blots generated from RNA extracted from pneumovirus-infected cells or tissue over time and probed with the differentially expressed amplicons serve to confirm differential expression of the identified sequence.
        
          Figure 2
          
            Display of amplicons generated from RNA extracted from RSV-infected cells at daily intervals following infection (days 0–4) using a single anchoring primer, T11GC (downstream primer 8) and (A-H) eight random 10mers. Two differentially expressed sequences are highlighted by arrows (the black arrow shows an upregulated amplicon, and the white arrow highlights a downregulated amplicon). Several other differentially expressed signals are also seen.
          
          
        
        The DNA sequences of the newly identified differentially expressed amplicons are compared with sequences present in the GenBank database. Viral sequences are expected to be upregulated over time and can be identified immediately, because the entire genomes of both PVM and RSV are present in GenBank. In cases in which the amplicon represents a newly discovered gene, potential open-reading frames are compared with sequences that are present in the Swiss protein database; motifs that share homologies with known proteins represent important clues to the identity of the differentially expressed gene.
        With the help of differential display, we have identified and characterized several genes that are upregulated in RSV-infected respiratory epithelial cells. Two specific examples of genes that were found to be induced during RSV infection, and later characterized as playing independent roles in the pathophysiology of RSV infection, are the antiapoptosis gene IEX-1L  and the gene that encodes the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin-17 .
        Unlike DNA viruses, which are known to encode virus-specific antiapoptosis genes, RSV — an RNA virus with a small (approximately 15.2 kb) viral genome — was shown to alter host cell expression of the apoptosis inhibitor IEX-1L. After demonstrating that IEX-1L mRNA was present at sevenfold higher concentrations in RSV-infected respiratory epithelial cells when compared with uninfected cells, we concluded that this cellular response protected against TNF-α-induced programmed cell death during viral infection. Further efforts to determine which of the 11 RSV proteins participate in the transactivation of the IEX-1L gene (either directly or indirectly) are ongoing.
        A second example of a gene that is specifically upregulated in RSV-infected respiratory epithelium, as identified by differential display, is that which encodes cytokeratin-17 . Upon characterizing the molecular events that are important for cytokeratin-17 induction, we demonstrated a link to an NF-κB signaling pathway. Above, we discussed the importance of this transcription factor in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression, and because of this involvement we were not surprised to discover its role in virus-induced cytokeratin-17 gene regulation. Perhaps the most interesting observation made during these experiments was the in situ localization of cytokeratin-17 protein to areas of cytopathic syncytia formation, suggesting a role for this cytoskeletal protein in their formation. Of note, we observed a dramatic decrease in RSV replication and in syncytia formation when we blocked cytokeratin-17 expression, suggesting that blocking syncytia formation, at least in part, impairs the direct cell–cell spread and productive replication of virus.
      
      
        Gene arrays
        Although there are several companies that market these systems and components, the cytokine gene macroarray systems recently developed by R&D Systems (Sigma Genosys®; Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Clontech (Atlas®; Palo Alto, CA, USA) represent some of the newer opportunities available that have a focus on gene products that are known to be involved in inflammation. These arrays consist of different cDNAs printed as PCR products onto charged nylon membranes. An example of our experience with the Sigma Genosys array is shown in Fig. 3. For this example, total RNA was extracted from RSV-infected HEp-2 cells and uninfected controls at day3 after infection. Three micrograms of total RNA was used in a cDNA synthesis reaction, using a proprietary mixture of 378 primer pairs and trace amounts of 32P-radiolabeled dCTP. The resulting radiolabeled products were hybridized to the macroarrays overnight at 65°C, and then washed and exposed to film. The arrow highlights one of the most obviously upregulated sequences from this experiment, which was identified as the gene encoding human MIP-1α. The physiologic importance of MIP-1α upregulation during human RSV infection and during rodent PVM bronchiolitis has already been described.

Signal intensity of each gene under each condition is compared. The arrow highlights the signal for human MIP-1α present at 12-fold higher concentration in infected epithelial cells compared with the uninfected controls.
          
          
        
        Microarrays can be differentiated from macroarrays in several ways. Among these differences, the microarray matrix is a glass or plastic slide, probes are labeled with fluorescent dye rather than via radioisotopes, and, most significantly, microarrays generally include a larger number and a higher density of imbedded sequences than do macroarrays. Although this may seem to be highly appealing at first, the massive amounts of data generated by microarray technology poses new challenges with respect to data normalization, management, and development of mathematical models to assist in data interpretation.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      The pneumoviruses RSV and PVM enter respiratory epithelial cells via a receptor-mediated event. During host-cell attachment and internalization, the target cell begins to alter its gene expression, which, among other events, involves the transcriptional upregulation of cytokine and chemokine genes. As RSV replication progresses, additional changes in cellular gene expression can be observed, including induction of the potent antiapoptosis gene IEX-1L and increased expression of the otherwise quiescent gene that encodes cytokeratin-17. What we know regarding the physiologic importance of these genes and their gene products has been described, but there is more to be learned. As the available technologies evolve, we can continue to capitalize on the use of genomic approaches as large-scale screening tools to identify genes that play important roles in the pathophysiology of pneumovirus infection. These elegant and simple tools will provide us with the means for thorough and systematic exploration of gene expression, both in the established in vitro cell culture models and in our new murine model of acute pneumovirus infection.

      Introduction
      Anaemia is a common condition in critically ill patients, and RBC transfusions are often used in the treatment and management of this patient population. In fact, one study  reported that 25% of all critically ill patients received RBC transfusions. Many laboratory studies  have examined the physiological responses (ie compensatory mechanisms) of the body to anaemia, which include the following : increased cardiac output, decreased blood viscosity, capillary changes, increased oxygen extraction, and other tissue adaptations to meet oxygen requirements. Although critically ill patients are affected by a number of factors that predispose them to the adverse consequences of anaemia, persistence of this condition is of particular concern because it may cause the compensatory mechanisms in these patients to become impaired, risking oxygen deprivation in vital organs . However, critically ill patients may also be at increased risk from the adverse effects of RBC transfusions, such as pulmonary oedema from volume overload, immune suppression resulting in increased risk of infection, and microcirculatory injury from poorly deformable RBCs.
      It is the aim of the present commentary to justify the statement 'Transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentration will not improve outcome.' If we define normal haemoglobin as being greater than 115 g/l for women and greater than 125 g/l for men, then there is no evidence in the literature to justify maintaining such high concentrations by the use of RBC transfusions in any anaemic patient. There may, however, be some debate about adopting a transfusion threshold of 100 g/l, which is well below 'normal'.
      It has recently been shown  that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. The practice of adhering to a lower transfusion threshold would, obviously, reduce the number of allogeneic RBCs transfused. It is our goal to impress upon the reader that transfusing to a level equal to or greater than 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. We first explore the reasons why a reduction in the total number of allogeneic blood transfusions would be beneficial. Second, we examine the current evidence for using a lower transfusion strategy, specifically that employed in the Transfusion Requirements In Critical Care (TRICC) trial.
    
    
      Potential consequences of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion
      RBC transfusions have inherent risks that may be categorized as follows : transfusion-transmitted infections; immune-related reactions (acute or delayed haemolytic reactions, febrile, allergic, anaphylactic reactions and graft-versus-host disease); and nonimmune-related reactions (fluid overload, hypothermia, electrolyte toxicity and iron overload).
      Major improvements in donor screening procedures and laboratory testing have dramatically improved the safety of the blood supply . Currently, the risk of transmitting an infectious agent through blood transfusion ranges from 1:100,000 for hepatitis B virus to 1:1,000,000 for HIV (Canadian Blood Services, personal communication, 2000). The most important threats to the blood supply remain new and unknown pathogens. More recently, concern has focused on the potential transmission of prions through RBCs. Also, infectious agents with long latency periods pose particular risks to young individuals who require RBCs, such as multiple trauma victims. The risk : benefit ratio for a 24-year-old trauma victim with a 50-year life expectancy differs markedly from that for a person aged 80 years who is undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. In summary, because there is a risk of transmitting diseases through the blood supply, we should always strive to use RBCs according to the best available evidence in order to ensure that we do more good than harm to our patients.
      It is a long-standing observation  that blood transfusions are associated with immune suppression. This clinical phenomenon was first observed in renal transplant patients who had received blood transfusions while on dialysis before the transplant , and has been observed repeatedly in transplant centres around the world . Recently, Opelz et al  reported a multicentre clinical trial in which all renal allograft recipients received modern immunosuppressive regimens. Those patients who were allocated to receive three allogeneic RBC units before renal transplant had a 1-year graft survival rate of 90%, as compared with 82% for patients who were not transfused (P = 0.02). These data suggest that there are long-term immunosuppressive effects following transfusion of non-leukocyte-reduced allogeneic RBCs.
      A large number of studies  have also suggested that allogeneic transfusions accelerate cancer growth, perhaps due to altered immune surveillance. These altered immune responses after allogeneic RBC transfusions may also predispose critically ill transfusion recipients to nosocomial infections  and increased rates of multiple-system organ failure , which may ultimately result in higher mortality rates. However, most studies that examined the association between cancer recurrence and postoperative infection after transfusion  only provided weak causal inferences because of poor study design and the lack of independence between allogeneic RBC transfusions and the potential complication.
      A recent meta-analysis  combined the results from seven RCTs, and was unable to detect clinically important decreases in mortality and postoperative infections. We added the results of a new RCT by van de Watering et al  to the above meta-analysis. The relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.88-1.25), and was 1.10 (95% confidence interval 0.85-1.43) for postoperative infections. However, this meta-analysis excluded two positive RCTs  because of the significant statistical heterogeneity introduced by these two studies. If all available RCTs are combined, ignoring heterogeneity, then the relative risk difference for postoperative infections across all studies is 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.00-2.56; P = 0.05). Thus, the available evidence suggests that universal prestorage leukoreduction could have clinical effects that range from none to decreasing rates of infection by as much as 50% in high-risk patients. In summary, despite convincing laboratory evidence and some supportive clinical studies, the clinical significance of the immunosup-pressive effects of allogeneic RBC transfusions have not been clearly established . More importantly, the impact of a leukoreduction programme has not been studied in a large population of patients who are expected to have significant exposure to allogeneic RBCs.
      The majority of complications from allogeneic RBC transfusion, however, are no more frequent in the intensive care setting than in other patient populations, with the possible exception of pulmonary oedema, hypothermia and electrolyte disturbance. Hypothermia and electrolyte disturbances occur most frequently with massive transfusions. In critically ill patients, the optimal effective circulatory volume may be difficult to determine, and as a consequence pulmonary oedema may be a much more frequent complication of RBC transfusion than in other patient populations. This may explain the significantly higher rate of pulmonary oedema in patients transfused using a threshold of 100 g/l (5.3% in the restrictive transfusion group versus 10.7% in the liberal transfusion group; P < 0.01), as reported in the TRICC trial . As an alternative explanation, the more frequent use of RBCs might have resulted in more frequent episodes of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the liberal strategy group (7.7% in the restrictive strategy versus 11.4% in the liberal strategy; P = 0.06), as reported in the TRICC trial.
      Clinical evidence is also insufficient to definitively establish a correlation between the age of RBCs being transfused and patient mortality; however, laboratory evidence has shown many storage-related changes that may result in impairment of blood flow and oxygen delivery at the microcirculatory level. Marik et al  demonstrated an association between a fall in gastric intramucosal pH and transfusion of RBCs stored for longer than 15 days. In addition, there is ample laboratory evidence that prolonged RBC storage adversely affects RBCs, potentially results in the generation of cytokines, and alters host immune function. In another study, Fitzgerald et al , using an animal model of transfusion, consistently observed a lack of efficacy of transfused, stored rat blood to improve tissue oxygen consumption as compared with fresh cells or other blood substitutes.
      Three retrospective clinical studies tested the association between the age of transfused blood and duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)  and mortality . Martin et al  observed a statistically significant association between the transfusion of aged blood (>14 days old) and increased duration of ICU stay (P = 0.003) in 698 critically ill patients. In patients who received a transfusion, aged RBCs was the only predictor of duration of stay (P < 0.0001). In survivors, only median age of blood was predictive of duration of stay (P < 0.0001). Purdy et al  demonstrated a negative correlation (r = -0.73) between the proportion of RBC units of a given age transfused to survivors and increasing age of RBCs in patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe sepsis (n = 31). Those investigators also noted that these latter units were more likely to be older. A recently reported study by Vamvakas and Carven  evaluated the effect of duration of RBC storage on postoperative pneumonia in 416 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Those investigators noted an adjusted increase of 1% in the risk of postoperative pneumonia per day of average increase in the duration of RBC storage (P < 0.005) in transfused patients. Each of these three studies also noted that patients who received a large number of RBC units had a higher mortality. Although these risks are relatively small when viewed collectively, they become significant when one considers that 25% of all critically ill patients in Canada are transfused during their ICU stay .
    
    
      Transfusion strategies
      Until recently, physicians have depended on clinical judgement when deciding at what haemoglobin level to transfuse a critically ill patient. As a result, significant variation has been shown to exist in transfusion practice among Canadian critical care physicians , which is due largely to a lack of published data on the subject. An arbitrary haemoglobin level of 100 g/l has historically been used as a threshold to transfuse critically ill patients.
      Six observational studies investigated the importance of anaemia on transfusion practices in various settings. Of these, three large cohort studies, which were performed in different patient populations (intensive care , coronary artery bypass surgery  and hip fractures ), reached different conclusions. RBC transfusions in particular improved outcome in critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease, but increased the risk of myocardial infarction in coronary artery bypass surgery patients. Transfusion had no impact on short-term or long-term mortality in hip-fracture patients. Three smaller studies  evaluated the relationship between anaemia and adverse outcomes in vascular disease patients. Although increased numbers of ischaemic events were observed in anaemic patients, the validity of these studies is uncertain, given that the decision to transfuse a patient was often correlated with illness burden of the patient. It is also possible that comorbidity was not adequately adjusted for in those studies.
      Transfusion thresholds were compared in 10 randomized clinical trials . Although the clinical settings varied, each trial randomized patients to be transfused on the basis of a 'conservative' or a 'liberal' strategy. The definitions of conservative and liberal strategies varied, and actually overlapped between studies. Of these 10 trials, only three included more than 100 patients and only one trial evaluated the impact of transfusion on symptoms. In the first trial of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery , the differences between perioperative haemoglobin levels were small, event rates were very low, and there were no differences in any outcome. In the second trial , patients undergoing knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive autologous blood transfusion immediately after surgery or to receive autologous blood if haemoglobin level fell below 9 g/dl . Again, no differences in outcome were observed. The third trial of hip fracture patients undergoing surgical repair  found no differences in outcomes; however, five deaths were recorded at 60 days after surgery in the symptomatic group, and two deaths occurred in the 10 g/dl group. The numbers of patients in these trials were too small to evaluate the effect of lower transfusion triggers on clinically important outcomes such as mortality, morbidity and functional status.
      In 1999, Hebert et al  reported the results of the TRICC trial. Patients (n = 838) were randomized either to a restrictive strategy (haemoglobin concentration maintained between 70 and 90 g/l, with a trigger set at 70 g/l) or to a liberal strategy (haemoglobin concentration maintained between 100 and 120 g/l, with a trigger at 100 g/l). To date, the TRICC trial is the only large study that has investigated these parameters. The groups were comparable at baseline. The average daily haemoglobin concentration ranged from 85 ± 7.2 g/l in the restrictive group to 107 ± 7.3 g/l in the liberal group (P < 0.01). The average number of transfusions was reduced by 52% in the restrictive group (2.6 ± 4.1 versus 5.6 ± 5.3 RBCs/patient; P < 0.01). Cardiac events, primarily pulmonary oedema and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in the liberal strategy (P < 0.01; Table 1). On examination of composite outcomes, the number of patients with multiorgan failure was found to be substantially increased in both groups, with the results being marginally better in the restrictive strategy group (20.6% versus 26.0%; P = 0.07; Table 2). Overall, the restrictive transfusion group showed a lower 30-day mortality (18.7% versus 23.3%; P = 0.11; Fig. 1). Kaplan-Meier survival curves, however, were significantly different in the subgroup of patients with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 20 or less (P = 0.02; Fig. 2). In addition, although 60-day mortality (22.8% versus 26.5%; P = 0.23) and ICU mortality (13.9% versus 16.2%; P = 0.29) were not statistically significant, they did show a consistent trend in terms of absolute values that favoured the restrictive strategy. The key observation from the TRICC trial is not that the restrictive strategy is better, but rather that it is at worst equivalent to the liberal strategy and at best superior to the liberal strategy.
    
    
      Subgroups that are at increased risk from anaemia
      At this juncture, preclinical and clinical evidence support the adoption of a more restrictive transfusion strategy in most critically ill patients. However, there remain divergent views regarding the risks and benefits of treating anaemia in patients with cardiovascular disease. Laboratory-based studies  suggest that patients with cardiovascular disease may require higher haemoglobin concentrations to maintain oxygen delivery in partially occluded or diseased coronary arteries. Studies to demonstrate how anaemia affects contractile function of the left ventricle have rarely shown important effects above haemoglobin concentrations of 70 g/l. Indeed, it is more important to address the underlying pathophysiological causes of the acute coronary syndrome with proven therapy such as aspirin and β-blockers, rather than treating mild-to-moderate anaemia as an initial step. If the effects of RBC transfusion were either limited or increased then there would be no debate; however, the use of allogeneic RBCs has been shown to be associated with immunomodulation  and/or alteration in the delivery of oxygen in the microcirculation , resulting in increased rates of infections and organ failure.
      Few clinical studies have attempted to elucidate the risk : benefit ratio of anaemia and transfusion in cardiac patients. Two small RCTs  examined transfusion practice in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and concluded that a conservative approach to the administration of RBCs may be safe. However, two recent cohort studies suggested that anaemia may increase the risk of mortality in critical illness  and following surgery in patients with cardiovascular disease .
      In a study of Jehovah's Witnesses (a group that refuses RBC transfusion on religious grounds) undergoing surgical procedures , it was noted that mortality was significantly increased in patients with cardiac disease after a decrease in haemoglobin levels from 100-110 g/l to 60-69 g/l. In that study, patients with no cardiac disease and similar changes in haemoglobin levels showed no increase in mortality, which is in accordance with the results of the TRICC trial . In the study by Hébert et al.  of 4470 critically ill patients, a correlation between anaemia and mortality rates was observed. Those investigators also found that the risk of anaemia appeared to decrease with RBC transfusion in patients with cardiac disease. In patients with cardiac disease, mortality increased when haemoglobin concentrations were below 95 g/l, as compared with anaemic patients with other diagnoses (55% versus 42%; P = 0.09). In the subgroup of patients with cardiac disease, increasing haemoglobin values in anaemic patients was associated with improved survival (odds ratio 0.80 for each 10 g/l increase; P = 0.012). One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the TRICC trial and this observational study may be that the attending physicians who recruited patients into the study did not enter those patients who were considered to have severe cardiac disease.
      Hébert et al.  sought to examine further whether a restrictive transfusion strategy was at least as effective as a liberal strategy in critically ill patients with cardiac disease. In the subgroup of patients with cardiovascular disease from the TRICC trial, those investigators suggested that most haemodynamically stable critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease may be transfused when haemoglobin concentrations fall below 70 g/l, and that the hemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 70 and 90 g/l. Average daily haemoglobin concentrations were 85 ± 6.2 g/l in the restrictive transfusion group and 103 ± 6.7 g/l in the liberal transfusion group (P < 0.01). In the 357 patients with cardiovascular disease, the 30-day mortality rate was 23% in the restrictive transfusion group versus 23% in the liberal group (95% confidence interval of the difference -8.4% to 9.1%; P = 1.00). Other mortality rates, including 60-day (26% versus 27%; P = 0.90), ICU (19% versus 16%; P = 0.49) and hospital mortality (27% versus 28%; P = 0.81), were not significantly different between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing time to death demonstrated similar trends in the two groups (Fig. 3; P = 0.98). The multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) scores, during the entire study period, were also not significantly different between groups (8.6 ± 4.9 versus 9.0 ± 4.4; P = 0.40), but the change in MOD score from baseline values was significantly lower in the restrictive group than in the liberal group (0.2 ± 4.2 versus 1.3 ± 4.4; P = 0.02).
      Combined measures of morbidity and mortality, or composite outcomes, were also examined. When all patients who died were given a score of 24, the total MOD score between groups was not different (P = 0.39), or were the changes in MOD scores significantly different from baseline (2.7 ± 6.9 versus 4.0 ± 7.3; P = 0.08). Among the specific subset of cardiac patients with ischaemic heart disease (n = 257), there were no discernible differences in 30-day and 60-day as well as ICU mortality rates. However, a nonsignificant (P = 0.3) decrease in overall survival rate in the restrictive group was noted in those patients with confirmed ischaemic heart disease, severe peripheral vascular disease or severe comorbid cardiac disease (Fig. 4).
      In conclusion, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy generally appears to be safe in most critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease, with the possible exception of patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
    
    
      Conclusion
      The need to reduce the amount of allogeneic blood transfusions in order to reduce the associated risks has been firmly established. RBCs are associated with clinically important immune suppression, and stored RBCs have been shown to cause adverse microcirculatory effects that result in increased organ failure.
      The question for some time has been whether critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin without deleterious effects, thus reducing the amount of exposure to allogeneic transfusions. In the only large RCT, Hébert et al  established that there was no difference in mortality rates between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies in noncardiac, critically ill patients. Although those investigators were able to show convincing trends that the liberal strategy may in fact be deleterious in terms of absolute values, statistical significance was not achieved. However, the fact that no difference between the two strategies was achieved is of great importance, because this means that the total number of transfusions can be reduced by approximately half without any impact on mortality. In addition, these findings are easily put into clinical practice. Although many questions remain, the TRICC trial and many laboratory and clinical studies have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. As such, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of RBCs, save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.

      Introduction
      This year's symposium was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials. After 10 years of 'magic bullet' trials in sepsis, a number of successful therapeutic options are now emerging. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the soup of mediators observed in sepsis offer yet more tantalizing targets for new therapies.
      In contrast, the eagerly awaited results from Italy of the prone positioning trial in ARDS were disheartening. The epidemiology of both sepsis and ARDS, and their impact on clinical studies and the future provision of critical care were also hot topics. The era of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy is upon us, with considerable early promise and the probability of wide availability. Finally, as always, ethics remained an area of interest.
      This report summarizes and discusses the presentations on the above topics.
    
    
      Sepsis
      Angus (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) presented his group's work on the epidemiology of sepsis in the USA (accepted for publication in Critical Care Medicine). They developed a method for identifying hospitalized patients with sepsis based on ICD9 criteria, the most widely recorded coding system used in US hospitals. Prospective testing of the method found it to be both sensitive and reliable. They then applied it to a representative selection of US hospitals. Their results indicated that about 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients have systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and that approximately 20% of these progress to severe sepsis. Mortality for severe sepsis was greater than 30%. Demographically, those at the extremes of age represent the most at-risk groups, in whom the mortality is also the highest. These data provides yet another reminder that the increasing demands on health care resources caused by the ageing population is predicted to exceed intensive care provision within the next 10-20 years. Finally, those investigators found a striking demographic peak in patients aged 20-30 years, which they attributed largely to human immunodeficiency virus.
      The long-standing debate between the two schools of sepsis theory - microcirculatory dys-autoregulation versus cellular dysfunction - shows signs of resolution. New techniques for studying tissue oxygen tension, presented by Ince (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), provide more evidence that microcirculatory dys-autoregulation results in significant shunting. This occurs predominantly in the submucosal and serosal portions of organs, and is an early event. These studies show that the macroscopic restoration of global oxygen delivery fails to improve oxygen consumption as the mucosa becomes hyperoxic, whereas the submucosa and serosa remain hypoxic. Somewhat counterintuitively, this can be reversed in the face of resistant hypotension with vasodilators, at least in animal models.
      The cellular dysfunction camp, although still somewhat doubtful as to the importance of these microcirculatory findings, have now clearly established that their championed mechanism of mitochondrial failure is a late but crucial event in the evolution of sepsis. Fink (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) presented evidence that mitochondrial failure in septic cells is triggered by the activation of the enzyme poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase . This enzyme represents a significant target for novel therapies, which are apparently already in development. The debate regarding the toxicity of oxygen and the formation of free radicals continues despite the absence of demonstrated effectiveness of scavenging therapies, and is a testament to the incomplete understanding of this area.
      The round-table conference preceding this year's symposium concentrated on distilling current knowledge on the microscopic events in critically ill patients into an explanation of the macroscopic multiorgan failure that is so commonly encountered. The conclusions of the conference appeared to relate mostly to future directions for research, in particular the study of organ-organ interactions. Marshall (Toronto, Canada) proposed the development of an alternative to the much-maligned physiological scoring systems, based on the staging systems widely used in the field of oncology. He proposed that mediator levels, in addition to physiological variables, will soon be used usefully to characterize septic patients. He also suggested that, in the light of the recent successful mediator trials in sepsis, future therapies will be directed in a manner analogous to the control of glucose in diabetic patients.
      The natural anticoagulants antithrombin III (AT III), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and activated protein C (APC), and the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α are the latest inflammatory mediators to be targeted in large multicentre clinical trials in an attempt to improve the current dismal outcome for patients with severe sepsis.
      The KyberSept AT III study recruited over 2300 patients from 200 centres, with high Simplified Acute Physiology Scale scores (median 50), and a mortality of nearly 40% . Unfortunately, no overall benefit was shown between AT III and placebo, although results were more encouraging in an analysis of the subgroup of patients who received AT III but no heparin, which is known to inhibit AT III. Interestingly, improvements in quality of life scores were seen in survivors who received AT III in comparison to those who received placebo, suggesting that morbidity may be reduced, although again this was an analysis of a subgroup. Patients in the AT III group who received concomitant heparin had a significantly higher incidence of bleeding events, and outcome worsened as the dose of heparin increased. Explanations for the failure of this study included the inhibitory effects of heparin and the failure to achieve AT III activity levels of greater that 200% from baseline in the treatment population, a level established as required for therapeutic benefit in phase II trials.
      Phase II clinical trial results using TFPI (TFPI n = 141, placebo n = 69; unpublished data) show a mortality benefit in the sicker sepsis patients who already have coagulation problems. Results of the phase III multicentre study are expected to be presented at the 22nd International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, in Brussels in 2002.
      Human trials of various anti-TNF-α formulations have been variable to date, and include North American sepsis trial (NORASEPT) I , International sepsis trial (INTERSEPT)  and NORASEPT II . Possible reasons have included a lack of biological activity of the anti-TNF-α formulation studied, inappropriate timing of therapy, redundancy of proinflammatory mediators and hetereogeneity of patient populations. The Monoclonal Anti-TNF, A Randomized controlled Sepsis Trial (MONARCS) study used a different anti-TNF-α formulation (F [ab']2 fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody to human TNF-α), and stratified patients based on demonstrable abnormalities in immunological pathways (highly elevated interleukin-6 levels - a circulating cytokine that is induced by TNF-α). Unpublished results revealed 28-day mortality rates of 44 and 48% in the anti-TNF-α and placebo groups, respectively, in those patients who had high interleukin-6 levels on recruitment to the study (n = 488 anti-TNF-α, n = 510 placebo). This represented a relative mortality reduction of 14%. Relative mortality reduction in all patients (n = 1305 anti-TNF-α, n = 1329 placebo), independent of baseline interleukin-6 levels, was only 10%.
      The Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study is hot off the press , and presentation of the results at the congress allowed those of us who still carry the unopened New England Journal of Medicine issue in our briefcases to catch up! A total of 164 sites from 11 countries recruited 1690 patients with severe sepsis, before the trial was prematurely stopped following the second safety analysis. Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality rates for placebo and APC were 31 and 25% respectively, with a relative risk reduction of 19%. Resolution of cardiovascular and respiratory function was more rapid in survivors who received APC, although ICU and hospital stay did not differ. There was a trend towards an increase in serious bleeding events in the APC group (3% APC versus 2% placebo), but these events were primarily due to trauma or instrumentation. Although this is an exciting breakthrough, we all recognize that when APC reaches the market place it will seriously stretch ICU finances, especially because there appear to be other mediators on the horizon that we will be encouraged to use, in combination, to fight the inflammatory 'soup'.
    
    
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome
      Two opposing epidemiological views of ARDS were presented by Lemaire (Créteil, France) and Evans (London, UK). Broad agreement does seem to exist as to the incidence of this condition, which is in the order of 10/100,000, although there is significant variation between countries. It was argued that this variation results from the availability of ventilated beds, with higher incidences apparent in countries with greater provision, emphasizing that this condition can be considered the result of intensive care intervention or, as one speaker put it, 'physician-induced lung injury'.
      Early results from the Acute Lung Injury Verification of European Epidemiology (ALIVE) study (unpublished data), sponsored by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, are at odds with recent trial findings. The ALIVE study, which included over 6000 patients surveyed in 1998, found a 50-60% 28-day mortality, which compares to only 20-30% in the control groups of recent trials. Pneumonia was the commonest cause, responsible for 50% of cases, with sepsis identified as the cause in a further 20-30%. Astonishingly, this study found the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen at ICU admission was highly predictive of mortality, despite continuing controversy regarding this measurement.
      A diverse range of views were presented from the Third International Consensus Conference on ARDS (unpublished data), held in Barcelona late last year. The decision as to how to change the defining criteria for this condition remains unresolved. The debates surrounding chest X-ray criteria, the use of the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen, and the level/utility of pulmonary artery wedge pressure measurements continue. In addition, a debate has arisen as to whether ARDS can be a unilateral process, and whether it can coexist with cardiac failure. There appears to be increasing recognition that ARDS represents only a small subset of patients with acute lung failure (approximately 30%). Surprisingly little is known about the remainder of this larger group. In contrast to the ALIVE study, several centres have reported their 28-day mortality at 40%, which represents an improvement from the 60% of 10 years ago. However, it was argued that a 28-day follow-up period is too short for clinical trials, as the long-term quality of life for patients with ARDS is poor compared with that of critically ill patients without this condition. Results suggest that the recovery of lung function is good overall, but is dependent on severity. Treatment recommendations include the universal adoption of the US National Institutes of Health protective lung ventilation strategy . There was general agreement that recruitment manoeuvres are beneficial, but how and when to employ them remains controversial.
      Rouby (Paris, France) put forward a new classification for ARDS based on computed tomography findings. He observed that patients can be split into three groups, depending on the appearance of the upper lobes. In group 1 the upper lobes are normal, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is of little benefit and results in significant over-distension. Survival in this group is approximately 60%. In group 2 the upper lobes are abnormal, PEEP is of dramatic benefit, but survival is only approximately 25%. In group 3 there are mixed/patchy abnormalities, the effects of PEEP are less predictable, but, as in group 1, survival is approximately 60%.
      Gattinoni (Milan, Italy) presented the results of the long-awaited Italian multicentre randomized controlled trial of prone positioning in ARDS (unpublished data). This trial was terminated after 3 years despite having only recruited 304 patients; enrollment of 750 patients was originally planned, in order to achieve sufficient statistical power. At trial outset, recruitment was encumbered by the lack of familiarity with and scepticism regarding this procedure in many of the centres. However, by the end of the study many participants were unwilling to enter patients into the trial, because they felt it unethical to deny them this intervention. The trial protocol resulted in patients in the treatment group being prone for an average of only 7 out of 24 h for a 10-day period. Overall there was no difference in mortality between the control and treatment groups at day 10, time of ICU discharge, or at 6 months. Interestingly, analysis of subgroups revealed a significant difference in the outcome at 10 days for patients with the most severe disease, although this disappeared by ICU discharge. In retrospect, the design of this ambitious trial was flawed by its failure to establish the optimal utilization of this manoeuvre.
    
    
      Extracorporeal techniques for liver failure
      The opening session reported that we are making progress in supporting the failing liver (Wendon, London, UK). Current optimism should probably be limited to extra-corporeal methods, because the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (essentially extracorporeal albumin dialysis) has been shown to have beneficial clinical effects as well as improved survival in two small randomized controlled trials . The equipment is familiar to all those who use dialytic therapies, and we will undoubtedly hear more about this system in the next few years.
    
    
      Noninvasive mechanical ventilation
      The slide of a patient reading the newspaper through a transparent helmet, while receiving noninvasive ventilation (NIV) resembled pictures of a NASA astronaut! However, it was reported to be well tolerated for prolonged periods, and significantly reduces the complications associated with NIV (pressure areas, tolerance of mask). The recent Consensus Conference  examined weaning aspects of NIV and emphasized the reduced weaning time and avoidance of reintubation, but called for more randomized controlled trials. Finally, although continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to be beneficial in pulmonary oedema, caution is still advised with the use of bilevel positive airway pressure because of the reporting of myocardial infarction in several studies. However, the groups studied were unmatched and starting points were different, so conclusions should not be drawn until randomized controlled trial results are available in this area.
    
    
      Ethics
      This was a well-attended session, which, according to Levy (Providence, RI, USA), was in complete contrast to the interest shown in the USA for the subject. Although there were few new data in the session, the emphasis on a strategy for lawsuits was welcome. Suggestions included statements from scientific societies at a national and international level, open reporting in medical files of decisions to withdraw or withhold treatment, and family involvement in decision making that will ultimately involve better media education.
    
    
      Conclusion
      The last day of this year's symposium was sadly abandoned by many due to the Belgian rail strike. Despite this, the usual convivial atmosphere, both in and around the congress, was as abundant as ever. Overall, the 'state of the art' lectures, pro/con debates, seminars and tutorials were of the usual high standard, although, yet again, access to many of the symposium's venues was limited by the lack of capacity of the secondary rooms. The 21st International Symposium was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm that real positive progress is occurring at the coal face of intensive care.

      Introduction
      The heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO) system has recently seen an explosion of research interest due to its newly discovered physiological effects. This metabolic pathway, first characterized by Tenhunen et al. , has only recently revealed its surprising cytoprotective properties . Research in HO-1/CO now embraces the entire field of medicine where reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, inflammation, growth control, and apoptosis represent important pathophysiological mechanisms [3-6]. Indeed, the number of publications in recent years concerning HO-1 has increased exponentially, while the list of diseases and physiological responses associated with changes in HO-1 continues to expand .
      Until now, relatively few studies have addressed the role of HO-1/CO in pulmonary medicine. Several investigators have focused on the diagnostic application of the HO-1/CO system, by measuring exhaled CO (E-CO) in various pathological pulmonary conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . In another experimental approach, investigators have examined the expression of HO-1 in lung tissue from healthy or diseased subjects . This review will highlight the actions of HO-1/CO in the context of pulmonary diseases (Fig. 1), emphasizing potential protective effects against inflammation, allergic reactions, oxidative stress, endotoxin shock, apoptosis, and tumor/cell growth [10-17].

          Role of heme oxygenase and carbon monoxide in lung diseases. Heme oxygenase (HO) generates biliverdin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO) from the oxidation of heme. Exhaled CO reflects active heme metabolism. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis represent an axis of disease, against which both endogenous HO activity and exogenous CO exert protective effects. CO may inhibit both inflammation and apoptosis. The toxicological properties of CO imply increased pro-oxidant activity; however, the pro-oxidant/and antioxidant consequences of CO in the physiological range remain unclear. The bile pigments biliverdin IXα and bilirubin IXα have demonstrated antioxidant properties, though their prospective roles in modulation of inflammation and apoptosis are currently under investigation. Iron (Fe) released from HO activity returns to a transient chelatable pool, where it may potentially promote oxidative stress and apoptosis. Induction of ferritin synthesis and sequestration of the released iron into ferritin may represent one possible detoxification pathway that limits the potential of iron in pro-apoptotic and pro-oxidative processes.
        
        
      
    
    
      Review
      
        Heme oxygenase-1
        Heme oxygenase (HO, EC 1.14.99.3) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in heme degradation. In the HO reaction, the oxidation of heme generates equimolar ferrous iron, biliverdin IXα, and CO. NAD(P)H:biliverdin reductase subsequently converts bilverdin IXα into bilirubin IXα . The bile pigments generated during heme degradation have antioxidant properties . The liberated heme iron undergoes detoxification either by extracellular efflux or by sequestration into ferritin, an intracellular iron-storage molecule with potential cytoprotective function [20-23]. Of the three known isoforms of HO (HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3), only HO-1 responds to xenobiotic induction [24-27]. Constitutively expressed in many tissues, HO-2 occurs at high levels in nervous and vascular tissues, and may respond to regulation by glucocorticoids . HO-1 and HO-2 differ in genetic origin, in primary structure, in molecular weight, and in their substrate and kinetic parameters . HO-3 displays a high sequence homology with HO-2 but has little enzymatic activity . This review will focus on the inducible, HO-1, form.
        In addition to the physiological substrate heme, HO-1 responds to induction by a wide variety of stimuli associated with oxidative stress. Such inducing agents include hypoxia, hyperoxia, cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), heavy metals, ultraviolet-A (320–380 nm) radiation, heat shock, shear stress, hydrogen peroxide, and thiol (-SH)-reactive substances . The multiplicity of toxic inducers suggest that HO-1 may function as a critical cytoprotective molecule . Many studies have suggested that HO-1 acts as an inducible defense against oxidative stress, in models of inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, hypoxia, and hyperoxia-mediated injury (reviewed in ). The mechanisms by which HO-1 can mediate cytoprotection are still poorly understood. All three products of the HO reaction potentially participate in cellular defense, of which the gaseous molecule CO has recently received the most attention . The administration of CO at low concentrations can compensate for the protective effects of HO-1 in the presence of competitive inhibitors of HO-1 activity [32-34]. While HO-1 gene transfer confers protection against oxidative stress in a number of systems, clearly not all studies support a beneficial role for HO-1 expression. Cell-culture studies have suggested that the protective effects of HO-1 overexpression fall within a critical range, such that the excess production of HO-1 or HO-2 may be counterprotective due to a transient excess of reactive iron generated during active heme metabolism . Thus, an important caveat of comparative studies on the therapeutic effects of CO administration versus HO-1 gene delivery arises from the fact that the latter approach, in addition to producing CO, may have profound effects on intracellular iron metabolism.
        HO-1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. Genetic analyses have revealed two enhancer sequences (E1, E2) in the murine HO-1 gene located at -4 kb (E1) and -10 kbp (E2) of the transcriptional start site . These enhancers mediate the induction of HO-1 by many agents, including heavy metals, phorbol esters, endotoxin, oxidants, and heme. E1 and E2 contain repeated stress-responsive elements, which consist of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors including activator protein-1 (AP-1), v-Maf oncoprotein, and the cap'n'collar/basic-leucine zipper family of proteins (CNC-bZIP), of which Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor) may play a critical role in HO-1 transcription . The promoter region of HO-1 also contains potential binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), though the functional significance of these are not clear . Both NF-κB and AP-1 have been identified as regulatory elements responsive to oxidative cellular stress . In response to hyperoxic stress, AP-1 factors mediated the induction of HO-1 in cooperation with signal-transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins . Furthermore, a distinct hypoxia-response element (HRE), which mediates the HO-1 response to hypoxia, represents a binding site for the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) .
      
      
        Carbon monoxide
        The toxic properties of CO are well known in the field of pulmonary medicine. This invisible, odorless gas still claims many victims each year by accidental exposure. CO evolves from the combustion of organic materials and is present in smoke and automobile exhaust. The toxic actions of CO relate to its high affinity for hemoglobin (240-fold greater than that of O2). CO replaces O2 rapidly from hemoglobin, causing tissue hypoxia [43-45]. At high concentrations, other mechanisms of CO-induced toxicity may include apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of drug metabolism and respiratory enzyme functions .
        Only recently has it become known that, at very low concentrations, CO participates in many physiological reactions. Where a CO exposure of 10,000 parts per million (ppm) (1% by volume CO in air) is toxic, 100–250 ppm (one hundredth to one fortieth as much) will stimulate the physiological effects without apparent toxicity . The majority of endogenous CO production originates from active heme metabolism (>86%), though a portion may be produced in lipid peroxidation and drug metabolism reactions . Cigarette smoking, still practiced by many lung patients, represents a major source of chronic low-level exposure to CO. Inhaled CO initially targets alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells.
        The exact mechanisms by which CO acts at the molecular level remain incompletely understood. CO potentially exerts its physiological effects by influencing at least three known pathways (Fig. 2). By complexation with the heme moiety of the enzyme, CO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), stimulating the production of cyclic 3':5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) . The sGC/cGMP pathway mediates the effects of CO on vascular relaxation, smooth muscle cell relaxation, bronchodilation, neurotransmission, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation, coagulation, and smooth muscle proliferation [48-51]. Furthermore, CO may cause vascular relaxation by directly activating calcium-dependent potassium channels [52-54]. CO potentially influences other intracellular signal transduction pathways. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which transduce oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling (i.e. response to lipopolysaccharide), may represent an important target of CO action . An anti-apoptotic effect of CO and its relation to MAPK has recently been described. The overexpression of HO-1 or the exogenous administration of CO prevented tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis in murine fibroblasts . In endothelial cells, the anti-apoptotic effect of CO depended on the modulation of the p38 (38 kilodalton protein) MAPK pathway . The role of the remaining heme metabolites, (i.e. Fe and biliverdin IXα) in the modulation of apoptosis is currently being investigated and is beyond the scope of this review. Recent studies have reported a potent anti-inflammatory effect of CO, involving the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production after endotoxin stimulation, dependent on the modulation of p38 MAPK . The clinical relevance of p38 MAPK lies in the possibility of modulating this pathway in various clinical conditions to downregulate the inflammatory response .
        
          Figure 2
          
            Possible mechanism(s) of carbon monoxide action. Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) arises principally as a product of heme metabolism, from the action of heme oxygenase enzymes, although a portion may arise from environmental sources such as pharmacological administration or accidental exposure, or other endogenous processes such as drug and lipid metabolism. The vasoregulatory properties of CO, including its effects on cellular proliferation, platelet aggregation, and vasodilation, have been largely ascribed to the stimulation of guanylate cyclase by direct heme binding, leading to the generation of cyclic GMP. The anti-inflammatory properties of CO are associated with the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, dependent on the selective modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), such as the 38 kilodalton protein (p38MAPK). In addition to these two mechanisms, CO may potentially interact with any hemoprotein target, though the functional consequences of these interactions with respect to cellular signaling remain poorly understood.
          
          
        
      
      
        Involvement of HO-1 and CO in lung disease
        Oxidative stress arising from an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants plays a central role in the pathogenesis of airway disease . In lung tissue, HO-1 expression may occur in respiratory epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and to a large extent in alveolar macrophages . HO-1 induction in these tissues, in vitro and in vivo, responds to common causes of oxidative stress to the airways, including hyperoxia, hypoxia, endotoxemia, heavy metal exposure, bleomycin, diesel exhaust particles, and allergen exposure . Induction of HO-1 or administration of CO can protect cells from these stressful stimuli . In one of the experiments that best illustrate the protective role of CO in vivo, rats were exposed to hyperoxia (>98% O2) in the absence or presence of CO at low concentration (250 ppm). The CO-treated rats showed increased survival and a diminished inflammatory response to the hyperoxia . As demonstrated in a model of endotoxin-induced inflammation, the protection afforded by CO most likely resulted from the downregulated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-1β) and the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) . Furthermore, increases in exhaled CO (E-CO) have been reported in a number of pathological pulmonary conditions, such as unstable asthma, COPD, and infectious lung disease; these increases may reflect increased endogenous HO-1 activity . Elevated carboxyhemoglobin (Hb-CO) levels have also been reported in these same diseases in nonsmoking subjects, where both the E-CO and Hb-CO levels decrease to normal levels in response to therapy .
        E-CO in humans originates primarily from both systemic heme metabolism, which produces CO in various tissues, and localized (lung) heme metabolism, as a result of the combined action of inducible HO-1 and constitutive HO-2 enzymatic activity. Endogenously produced or inspired CO is eliminated exclusively by respiration . Elevation of E-CO may also reflect an increase in exogenous sources such as smoking or air pollution. In addition to changes in environmental factors, elevations of E-CO in lung diseases may reflect an increase in blood Hb-CO levels in response to systemic inflammation, as well as an increase in pulmonary HO-1 expression in response to local inflammation .
        The diagnostic value of measuring E-CO remains controversial due to many conflicting reports (i.e. some reports indicate differences in E-CO measurements between disease activity and controls, and some reports do not). The possible explanations for these discrepancies include large differences in patient populations and in the methods used for measuring E-CO, and undefined corrections for background levels of CO. Furthermore, remarkable differences arise between studies in the magnitude of the E-CO levels in the control groups as well as in treated or untreated asthma patients. When active or passive smoking occurs, or in the presence of high background levels of CO, the measurement of E-CO is not particularly useful for monitoring airway inflammation. In patients who smoke, E-CO can be used only to confirm the smoking habit . Comparable to the beginning era of measurements of exhaled NO, a standardization in techniques and agreement on background correction should be reached for E-CO measurements, to allow proper conclusions to be drawn in this area of investigation.
      
      
        Asthma and allergy
        Asthma, a form of allergic lung disease, features an accumulation of inflammatory cells and mucus in the airways, associated with bronchoconstriction and a generalized airflow limitation. Inflammation, a key component of asthma, involves multiple cells and mediators where an imbalance in oxidants/antioxidants contributes to cell damage. Several pathways associated with oxidative stress may participate in asthma. For example, the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 control the expression of proinflammatory mediators [59,67-69].
        In light of the potential protective effects of HO-1/CO on inflammatory processes, the study of HO-1 in asthma has gained popularity. In a mouse model of asthma, HO-1 expression increased in lung tissue in response to ovalbumin aerosol challenge, indicating a role for HO-1 in asthma . In a similar model of aeroallergen-induced asthma in ovalbumin-sensitized mice, exposure to a CO atmosphere resulted in a marked attenuation of eosinophil content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-5 . This experiment showed that exogenous CO can inhibit asthmatic responses to allergens in mice.
        Recent human studies have revealed higher HO-1 expression in the alveolar macrophages and higher E-CO in untreated asthmatic patients than in healthy nonsmoking controls . Patients with exacerbations of asthma and patients who were withdrawn from inhaled steroids showed higher E-CO levels than steroid-treated asthmatics or healthy controls . Higher levels of E-CO may also occur in children with persistent asthma than in healthy controls . E-CO levels may correlate with functional parameters such as peak expiratory flow rate. A low rate in asthma exacerbations correlated with high E-CO, whereas normalization of the rate with oral glucocorticoid treatment resulted in a reduction of E-CO . Furthermore, increased E-CO was associated with greater expression of HO-1 in airway alveolar macrophages obtained by induced sputum in untreated asthmatic patients than in controls. These asthma patients also showed higher bilirubin levels in the induced sputum, indicating higher HO activity . Furthermore, patients with asthma show an increased Hb-CO level at the time of exacerbation, with values decreasing to control levels after oral glucocorticoid treatment . In human asthmatics, E-CO and airway eosinophil counts decreased in response to a one-month treatment with inhaled corticosteroids . In direct contrast to such studies promoting E-CO as a useful noninvasive tool for monitoring airway inflammation, other studies reported no difference in E-CO levels of asthma patients versus healthy controls, or between patients with stable and unstable asthma. In one such report, no further change in E-CO occurred in asthma patients after a one-month treatment of inhaled corticosteroids, despite observed decreases in airway eosinophil content and bronchial responsiveness to metacholine . A recent study accentuates this finding in asthma excerbations, where no decrease in E-CO of children with asthma could be detected after oral prednisolone treatment . In human allergic responses, results on elevation of E-CO are also inconclusive. A clear elevation of E-CO after allergen exposure occurred in patients with asthma during the late response, and during the early response immediately after the inhalation . However, another report showed that no elevation of E-CO occurred in allergen-induced asthma within 48 hours after allergen challenge . Finally, increases in E-CO were measured in allergic rhinitis, correlating with seasonal changes in exposure to allergen (pollen) .
      
      
        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
        Airway inflammation plays an important role in the development of COPD, characterized by the presence of macrophages, neutrophils, and inflammatory mediators such as proteinases, oxidants, and cytokines. Furthermore, the inflammatory consequences of chronic microbiological infections may contribute to the progression of the disease. The current paradigm for the pathogenesis of COPD involves imbalances in protease/antiprotease activities and antioxidant/pro-oxidant status. Proteases with tissue-degrading capacity, (i.e. elastases and matrix metalloproteinases), when insufficiently inhibited by antiproteases, can induce tissue damage leading to emphysema. Oxidants that supersede cellular antioxidant defenses can furthermore inactivate antiproteases, cause direct injury to lung tissue, and interfere with the repair of the extracellular matrix. Smoking plays an important role in both hypotheses. Cigarette smoke will act primarily on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, which react to this oxidative stress by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and releasing growth factors. Nevertheless, smoking cannot be the only factor in the development of COPD, since only 15–20% of smokers develop the disease .
        Exposure to reactive oxygen species (from cigarette smoke or chronic infections) and an imbalance in oxidant/antioxidant status are the main risk factors for the development of COPD. To defend against oxidative stress, cells and tissues contain endogenous antioxidant defense systems, which include millimolar concentrations of the tripeptide glutathione (GSH). A close relation exists between GSH concentration and HO-1, whereby depletion of GSH augments the transcriptional regulation of HO-1 by oxidants, suggesting that the HO-1/CO system acts as a secondary defense against oxidative stress [83-86]. Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that HO-1/CO may also play an important part in COPD. Alveolar macrophages, which produce a strong HO-1 response to stimuli, may represent the main source of CO production in the airways . Patients with COPD have displayed higher E-CO than healthy nonsmoking controls . Furthermore, much higher levels of HO-1 have been observed in the airways of smokers than in nonsmokers . Among subjects who formerly smoked, patients with COPD have lower HO-1 expression in alveolar macrophages than healthy subjects . A microsatellite polymorphism that is linked with the development of COPD may occur in the promoter region of HO-1, resulting in a lower production of HO-1 in people who have the polymorphism. Thus, a genetically dependent downregulation of HO-1 expression may arise in subpopulations, possibly linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress [89-91]. Future studies on both genetic predisposition and possible therapeutic modalities will reveal the involvement of the HO-1/CO system in COPD.

        Cystic fibrosis (CF) involves a deposition of hyperviscous mucus in the airways associated with pulmonary dysfunction and pancreatic insufficiency, which may be accompanied by chronic microbiological infections. E-CO readings were higher in untreated versus oral-steroid-treated CF patients . Furthermore, E-CO increased in patients during exacerbations of CF, correlating to deterioration of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with normalization of the E-CO levels after treatment . E-CO levels may correlate with exhaled ethane, a product of lipid peroxidation that serves as an indirect marker of oxidative stress. Both E-CO and exhaled ethane were higher in steroid-treated and untreated CF patients than in healthy controls . E-CO was higher in children with CF than in control patients. In addition to the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to continuous infectious pressure in these patients, E-CO may possibly respond to hypoxia. E-CO increased further in CF children following an exercise test, and correlated with the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, a finding suggestive of an increased HO-1 expression in CF patients during hypoxic states induced by exercise .
      
      
        Infectious lung disease
        In patients with pneumonia, higher Hb-CO levels can be measured at the onset of illness, with values decreasing to control levels after antibiotic treatment . E-CO levels were reported to be higher in lower-respiratory-tract infections and bronchiectasis, with normalization after antibiotic treatment . Furthermore, E-CO levels in upper-respiratory-tract infections were higher than in healthy controls . The relationship between higher measured E-CO in these infectious states and higher Hb-CO levels cannot be concluded from these studies.
      
      
        Interstitial lung disease
        The role of HO-1 in the development of interstitial lung disease remains undetermined. Comparative immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that lung tissue of control subjects, patients with sarcoidosis, usual interstitial pneumonia, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia, all showed a high expression of HO-1 in the alveolar macrophages but a weak expression in the fibrotic areas . The antiproliferative properties of HO-1 suggest a possible beneficial role in limiting fibrosis; however, this hypothesis is complicated by a newly discovered relation between IL-10 and HO-1. IL-10 produced by bronchial epithelial cells promotes the growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts . HO-1 expression and CO treatment have been shown to increase the production of IL-10 in macrophages following proinflammatory stimuli . Conversely, IL-10 induces HO-1 production, which is apparently required for the anti-inflammatory action of IL-10 .
        A recent report clearly shows the suppression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by adenovirus-mediated HO-1 gene transfer and overexpression in C57BL/6 mice, involving the inhibition of apoptotic cell death . Overall, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of HO-1 in interstitial lung disease and its possible therapeutic implications.
      
      
        Lung cancer
        HO-1 action may be of great importance in solid tumors, an environment that fosters hypoxia, oxidative stress, and neovascularization. HO-1 may have both pro- and antagonistic effects on tumor growth and survival. HO-1 and CO cause growth arrest in cell-culture systems and thus may represent a potential therapeutic modality in modulating tumor growth . The overexpression of HO-1 or administration of CO in mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma mouse models resulted in improved survival (>90%) as well as reduction in tumor size (>50%) . Furthermore, HO-1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas can be useful in identifying patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis. High expression of HO-1 was detected in groups without lymph node metastasis in this report . In contrast to growth arrest, HO-1 may protect solid tumors from oxidative stress and hypoxia, possibly by promoting neovascularization. In one study, zinc protoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO-1 enzyme activity, suppressed tumor growth .
      
      
        Pulmonary vascular disease
        CO may represent a critical mediator of the body's adaptive response to hypoxia, a common feature in pulmonary vascular disease . Since CO can modulate vascular tone by inducing cGMP and large, calcium-dependent potassium channels, HO-1 and CO probably play important roles in pulmonary vascular diseases . A NO-mediated HO-1 induction occurred in the hepatopulmonary syndrome during cirrhosis, associated with enhancement of vascular relaxation . In portopulmonary hypertension, elevated levels of cGMP and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in the vascular endothelium, and HO-1 expression in macrophages and bronchial epithelium have been described . In transgenic mice models, ho-1-/-and ho-1+/+ mice did not differ in their development of pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia treatment, despite the development of right ventricular dilation and right myocardial infarction in ho-1-/- mice . The preinduction of HO-1 protein with chemical inducers, however, prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension in the rat lung as a consequence of chronic hypoxia treatment . Transgenic mice overexpressing HO-1 in the lung were resistant to hypoxia-induced inflammation and hypertension . Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of HO-1 and CO in primary human lung vascular diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension.
      
      
        Hyperoxic lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
        Supplemental oxygen therapy is often used clinically in the treatment of respiratory failure. Exposure to high oxygen tension (hyperoxia) may cause acute and chronic lung injury, by inducing an extensive inflammatory response in the lung that degrades the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to impaired gas exchange and pulmonary edema . Hyperoxia-induced lung injury causes symptoms in rodents that resemble human acute respiratory distress syndrome .
        Hyperoxia induced HO-1 expression in adult rats but apparently not in neonatal rats, in which the expression and activities of HO-1 and HO-2 are developmentally upregulated during the prenatal and early postnatal period .
        Both HO-1 and HO-2 potentially influence pulmonary adaptation to high O2 levels. In one example, the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of HO-1 into rat lungs protected against the development of lung apoptosis and inflammation during hyperoxia . In vitro studies showed that the overexpression of HO-1 in lung epithelial cells or rat fetal lung cells caused growth arrest and conferred resistance against hyperoxia-induced cell death . An oxygen-tolerant variant of hamster fibroblasts that moderately overexpressed HO-1 in comparison with the parent line resisted oxygen toxicity in vitro. The treatment of this oxygen-tolerant strain with HO-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the resistance to hyperoxia. In contrast, additional, vector-mediated, HO-1 expression did not further increase oxygen tolerance in this model .
        In vivo studies with gene-deleted mouse strains have provided much information on the roles of HO-1 and HO-2 in oxygen tolerance. Dennery et al. demonstrated that heme oxygenase-2 knockout mice (ho-2-/-) were more sensitive to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than wild-type mice . In addition to the absence of HO-2 expression, however, the mice displayed a compensatory increase in HO-1 protein expression, and higher total lung HO activity. Thus, in this model, the combination of HO-2 deletion and HO-1 overexpression resulted in a hyperoxia-sensitive phenotype. Recent studies of Dennery et al. have shown that HO-1- deleted (ho-1-/-) mice were more resistant to the lethal effects of hyperoxia than the corresponding wild type . The hyperoxia resistance observed in the ho-1-/- strain could be reversed by the reintroduction of HO-1 by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer . In contrast, mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from ho-1-/- mice showed increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of hemin and H2O2 and generated more intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to these agents . Both ho-1-/- and ho-2-/- strains were anemic, yet displayed abnormal accumulations of tissue iron. Specifically, ho-1-/- accumulated nonheme iron in the kidney and liver and had decreased total iron content in the lung, while ho-2-/- mice accumulated total lung iron in the absence of a compensatory increase in ferritin levels . The mechanism(s) by which HO-1 or HO-2 deletions result in accumulation of tissue iron remain unclear. These studies, taken together, have indicated that animals deficient in either HO-1 and HO-2 display altered sensitivity to oxidative stress conditions. Aberrations in the distribution of intra- and extra-cellular iron, may underlie in part, the differential sensitivity observed .
        Otterbein et al. have shown that exogenous CO, through anti-inflammatory action, may protect the lung in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. The presence of CO (250 ppm) prolonged the survival of rats in a hyperoxic (>95% O2) environment, and inhibited the appearance of markers of hyperoxia-induced lung injury (i.e. hemorrhage, fibrin deposition, edema, airway protein accumulation, and BALF neutrophil influx) . Furthermore, in a mouse model, CO inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in mice induced by the hyperoxia treatment. Using gene-deleted mice, Otterbein and colleagues also observed that the protection afforded by CO in this model, similar to a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of lung injury, depended on the p38 MAPK pathway (Otterbein et al., unpublished observation, as reviewed in ).
        In direct contrast to these studies, the group of Piantadosi and colleagues reported no significant difference in the hyperoxia tolerance of rats at CO doses between 50 and 500 ppm . In their model, CO did not alter the accumulation of fluid in the airway. Furthermore, CO, when applied in combination with hyperoxia, increased the activity of myeloperoxidase, a marker of airway neutrophil influx. This study also suggested that inhalation of CO (50–500 ppm) did not alter the expression of HO-1 or other antioxidant enzymes such as Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in vivo. Furthermore, Piantadosi and colleagues were able to induce oxygen tolerance in rats and HO-1 expression with hemoglobin treatment, but this tolerance also occurred in the presence of HO inhibitors, thereby not supporting a role for HO activity in oxygen tolerance . Although no consensus has been reached as to the protective role of CO inhalation and/or HO-1 induction in hyperoxic lung injury, human studies will be required to show if CO will supersede NO in providing a significant therapeutic benefit in the context of severe lung diseases . While antioxidant therapies have been examined, until now no human studies exist on the role of HO-1 and CO in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia .
      
      
        Lung transplantation
        Lung transplantation is the ultimate and often last therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. After lung transplantation, there remains an ongoing hazardous situation in which both acute and chronic graft failure, as well as complications of the toxic immunosuppressive regimen used (i.e. severe bacterial, fungal, and viral infections; renal failure; and Epstein-Barr-virus-related lymphomas), determine the outcome . The development of chronic graft failure, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), determines the overall outcome after lung transplantation. OB, which may develop during the first months after transplantation, is the main cause of morbidity and death following the first half-year after transplantation, despite therapeutic intervention. Once OB has developed, retransplantation remains the only therapeutic option available . Little is known about the pathophysiological background of OB. The possible determinants of developing OB include ongoing immunological allograft response, HLADR mismatch, cytomegalovirus infection, acute rejection episodes, organ-ischemia time, and recipient age . OB patients displayed elevated neutrophil counts in the BALF, and evidence of increased oxidant activity, such as increased methionine oxidation in BALF protein and decreases in the ratio of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in epithelial lining fluid. .
        So far, only very limited research data are available on the possible role for HO-1 in allograft rejection after lung transplantation. Higher HO-1 expression has been detected in alveolar macrophages from lung tissue in lung transplant recipients with either acute or chronic graft failure than in stable recipients . The protective role of HO-1 against allograft rejection has been shown in other transplantation models, in which solid organ transplantation typically benefits from HO-1 modulation. A higher expression of protective genes such as HO-1 has been observed in episodes of acute renal allograft rejection . Furthermore, the induction of HO-1 alleviates graft-versus-host disease . Adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in remarkable protection against rejection in rat liver transplants . The upregulation of HO-1 protected pancreatic islet cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion, supporting an anti-apoptotic function of HO-1 . HO-1 may confer protection in the early phase after transplantation by inducing Th2-dependent cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, while suppressing interferon-γ and IL-2 production, as demonstrated in a rat liver allograft model .
        Beneficial effects of HO-1 modulation have also been described in xenotransplantation models, in which HO-1 gene expression appears functionally associated with xenograft survival . In a mouse-to-rat heart transplant model, the effects of HO-1 upregulation could be mimicked by CO administration, suggesting that HO-derived CO suppressed the graft rejection . The authors proposed that CO suppressed graft rejection by inhibition of platelet aggregation, a process that facilitates vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction.
        HO-1 may also contribute to ischemic preconditioning, a process of acquired cellular protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury, as observed in guinea pig transplanted lungs . HO-1 overexpression provided potent protection against cold ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rat model through an anti-apoptotic pathway . The induction of HO-1 in rats undergoing liver transplantation with cobalt-protoporphyrin or adenoviral-HO-1 gene therapy resulted in protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury and improved survival after transplantation, possibly by suppression of Th1-cytokine production and decreased apoptosis after reperfusion . Until now, no reports have addressed E-CO measurements in lung transplantation, where it is possible that differences in E-CO will be found in patients with acute and chronic allograft rejection.
      
      
        Conclusion and future implications
        The evolution of CO in exhaled breath may serve as a general marker and diagnostic indicator of inflammatory disease states of the lung, though more research will be required to verify its reliability. Increases in exhaled CO presumably reflect changes in systemic and airway heme metabolic activity from the action of HO enzymes. Evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that HO-1 provides a protective function in many, if not all, diseases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, the exploitation of HO-1 for therapeutic gain could be achieved through the modulation of HO-1 enzyme activity or its up- and downstream regulatory factors, either by gene transfer, pharmacological inducers, or direct application of CO by gas administration or chemical delivery [142-145]. The CO-releasing molecules (transition metal carbonyls) developed by Motterlini et al.  show promise in the pharmacological delivery of CO for therapeutic applications in vascular and immune regulation. The CO-releasing molecules have been shown to limit hypertension in vivo and promote vasorelaxation in isolated heart and aortic rings .
        Ultimately, the challenge remains in applying the therapeutic potentials of HO-1 to the treatment of human diseases. In vivo models of transplantation have shown that HO-1 gene therapy protects against allograft rejection . Given the toxic therapy that every transplant patient receives, especially after lung transplantation, the field of transplantation medicine may bring the first frontier for human applications of HO-1 gene therapy or exogenous CO administration. The potential use of inhalation CO as a clinical therapeutic in inflammatory lung diseases has also appeared on the horizon. In one promising study, an inhalation dose of 1500 ppm CO at the rate of 20 times per day for a week produced no cardiovascular side effects . Cigarette smoking and CO inhalation at identical intervals produced comparable Hb-CO levels of approximately 5%. The question of whether or not CO can be used as an inhalation therapy will soon be replaced by questions of ""how much, how long, and how often?"" The fear of administering CO must be weighed against the severe toxicity of the immunosuppressive agents in current use, and the often negative outcome of solid organ transplantation.

      Introduction
      The efficiency of +1 ribosomal frameshifting at a specific codon is used as a sensor to regulate polyamine levels in mammalian cells. The frameshifting occurs in decoding the gene antizyme 1, which has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Protein sequencing showed that the reading-frame shift occurs at the last codon of ORF1, causing a proportion of ribosomes to enter ORF2 to synthesize a transframe protein (Matsufuji et al., 1995). ORF2 encodes the main functional domains (Matsufuji et al., 1990; Miyazaki et al., 1992) of antizyme but has no ribosome initiation site of its own. The antizyme 1 protein binds to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (Murakami et al., 1992a; Li and Coffino, 1993, 1994), inhibits it (Heller et al., 1976) and targets it for degradation by the 26S proteosome without ubiquitylation (Murakami et al., 1992b, 1999). ODC catalyzes the first and usually rate-limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines, conversion of ornithine to putrescine. Putrescine is a substrate for the synthesis of spermidine and spermine. Because of its inhibition of ODC, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the synthesis of polyamines. In addition, antizyme 1 is a negative regulator of the polyamine transporter (Mitchell et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1994; Sakata et al., 1997). As discovered by Matsufuji and colleagues (Gesteland et al., 1992) and Rom and Kahana (1994), increasing polyamine levels elevate frameshifting in decoding antizyme 1 mRNA and so increase the level of antizyme 1. Since antizyme 1 negatively regulates the synthesis and uptake of polyamines, the frameshifting is the sensor for an autoregulatory circuit. A second mammalian paralog of antizyme, antizyme 2, has very similar properties to antizyme 1, including the regulatory frameshifting, but does not stimulate degradation of ODC under certain conditions where antizyme 1 is active (Ivanov et al., 1998a; Zhu et al., 1999; Y.Murakami, S.Matsufuji, I.P.Ivanov, R.F.Gesteland and J.F.Atkins, in preparation). Just like antizyme 1, antizyme 2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the body but is 16 times less abundant than mRNA of antizyme 1 (Ivanov et al., 1998a). In addition to antizyme 1 and 2, mammals have a third paralog of the gene, antizyme 3 (also encoded by two ORFs), which is expressed only during spermatogenesis (Ivanov et al., 2000). Zebrafish also have multiple antizyme genes, which differ in their expression patterns and activities (Saito et al., 2000).
      Numerous studies have addressed the regulation of fungal ODC in response to exogenously added polyamines. In the cases examined, Physarum polycephalum (Mitchell and Wilson, 1983), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fonzi, 1989; Toth and Coffino, 1999) and Neurospora crassa (Barnett et al., 1988; Williams et al., 1992), added polyamines, especially spermidine, result in significant repression of ODC activity. The mechanisms of repression seem to vary from fungus to fungus and are apparently different from the mechanism of polyamine-dependent regulation of ODC in higher eukaryotes. In some cases, the existence of an antizyme-like protein has been suggested but has either been disproved, as in the case of N.crassa (Barnett et al., 1988), or has never been substantiated, as is the case with S.cerevisiae.
      As expected from their small cationic nature and ability to neutralize negative charges locally, polyamines play key roles in processes ranging from the functioning of certain ion channels (Williams, 1997), nucleic acid packaging, DNA replication, apoptosis, transcription and translation. The role of polyamines can be complex as illustrated by the transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine to a lysine residue to form hypusine in mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-5A, the only known substrate for this reaction (Tome et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1999). Spermine negatively regulates the growth of prostatic carcinoma cells at their primary site (Smith et al., 1995), but at later stages of tumor progression it fails to induce antizyme, which correlates with cells becoming refractory to spermine (Koike et al., 1999). Lack of antizyme function is also important in the early de-regulation of cellular proliferation in oral tumors (Tsuji et al., 1998) and probably others. The levels of polyamines are altered in many tumors, and inhibitors of polyamine synthesis are being tested for antiproliferative and cell death effects. The synthesis of ODC varies during the cell cycle in normal cells (Linden et al., 1985; Fredlund et al., 1995). It is induced by many growth stimuli and is constitutively elevated in transformed cells (Pegg, 1988; Auvinen et al., 1992) with some phosphorylated ODC being translocated to the surface membrane where it is important for mitotic cytoskeleton rearrangement events (Heiskala et al., 1999).
      Antizyme is one example of certain mRNA-contained signals that can elevate specific frameshifting >1000-fold above the background level of normal translational errors. In addition to antizyme, frameshifting is also involved in the decoding of some bacterial and yeast genes and especially in many mammalian Retroviruses and Coronaviruses, plant viruses and bacterial insertion sequences (Atkins et al., 1999). The site of frameshifting in both mammalian antizyme 1 and 2 mRNAs is UCC UGA, where quadruplet translocation occurs at UCCU (underlined) to shift reading to the +1 frame, immediately before the UGA stop codon of the initiating frame (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a). For the frameshifting to occur with an efficiency of 20% or more, it is important that the 3′ base of the quadruplet is the first base of a stop codon. Other important features are a pseudoknot just 3′ of the shift site and a specific sequence 5′ of the shift site (Matsufuji et al., 1995; Ivanov et al., 1998a). A pseudoknot 3′ of the shift site is a common stimulator for eukaryotic –1 frameshifting, but the synthesis of antizyme is the only known case utilizing +1 frameshifting.
      Comparative analysis of RNA sequences from different organisms is informative about important features and the different options selected by evolution. Since most of the known examples of programmed frameshifting are in viruses or chromosomal mobile elements, the opportunity for comparison of frameshift cassettes in divergent organisms where the time of divergence can be approximated is limited. A start has been made with the frameshifting required for bacterial release factor 2 expression (Persson and Atkins, 1998), but antizyme provides the first opportunity for such a comparison in eukaryotes. Antizyme genes in genetically tractable lower eukaryotes would be helpful for understanding the functionally important interactions responsible for autoregulatory programmed frameshifting.

        Identification of an antizyme gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe
        A search for DNA sequences encoding protein sequences homologous to Drosophila melanogaster antizyme (Ivanov et al., 1998b) and Homo sapiens antizyme 1 identified the same S.pombe anonymous cDNA clone (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. D89228). The similarity is limited (∼10% identity, 24% similarity to both human antizyme 1 and D.melanogaster antizyme); however, it is highest in regions that are most highly conserved among the previously identified antizymes (Figure 1A). Closer examination of the cDNA nucleotide sequence provided further evidence that it encodes an S.pombe homolog of antizyme. The initiating AUG codon for the ORF that is similar to higher eukaryotic antizymes (ORF2 of those genes) is not the 5′-most AUG in this cDNA. In fact, there are eight AUGs closer to the 5′ end. The first or the second AUGs would initiate translation of an ORF (ORF1) that overlaps the longer downstream ORF (ORF2) such that a +1 translational frameshifting event in the overlap would generate a protein product analogous to the products of antizyme genes from higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, the last 12 nucleotides of ORF1 (UGG-UGC-UCC-UGA) are identical to the last 12 nucleotides of mammalian antizyme 1 ORF1s, including the frameshift site. Eleven of these 12 nucleotides are identical to the corresponding regions of all previously identified antizyme genes (Figure 1B). Previous experiments with the mammalian frameshift sequence tested in S.pombe have shown that this short 12 nucleotide sequence, by itself, is sufficient to stimulate measurable levels (up to 0.5%) of +1 frameshifting (Ivanov et al., 1998c). To confirm the ORF configuration of the putative S.pombe antizyme gene, a region corresponding to the two overlapping ORFs plus ∼80 nucleotides of the 5′ UTR and 370 nucleotides of the 3′ UTR, was amplified from both S.pombe genomic DNA and a cDNA library. The sequence of the amplified DNA confirmed that there are indeed two overlapping ORFs with the deduced configuration. This sequence (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217277) differs from the previously sequenced cDNA clone by three nucleotides (two in the coding region and one in the 3′ UTR); one changes an alanine codon to proline, another is a silent mutation within a proline codon. Since the sequences from the cDNA library and genomic DNA are identical, we conclude that the differences with clone No. D89228 are most likely due to strain variation. This gene contains no introns within the amplified region.
        The S.pombe protein was tested for antizyme activity using a gene fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In this construct, ORF1 and ORF2 of antizyme are fused in-frame by deleting the T nucleotide that encodes U of the stop codon of ORF1. This GST–antizyme fusion gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography. ODC inhibitory activity was tested by incubating the recombinant antizyme protein with an S.pombe crude extract and then assaying the mixture for ODC activity. The results (Figure 2) show that the recombinant protein can inhibit S.pombe ODC. GST alone (1 µg) does not inhibit S.pombe ODC (data not shown). In light of these results, the S.pombe gene will be called S.pombe ODC antizyme (SPA). Interestingly, the S.pombe ODC was also inhibited by mouse antizyme 1 and antizyme 2 (both expressed as GST fusions); however, the yeast fusion protein did not inhibit mouse ODC (data not shown).
      
      
        Deletion and overexpression of SPA
        Although the effects of overexpression of antizyme on cellular physiology have been tested previously in mammalian cells, the physiological changes associated with complete absence of antizyme activity have not yet been investigated because of the complication of multiple antizymes. The single S.pombe antizyme provides the chance to explore a knockout. SPA deletion strains were generated by replacing the two ORFs of the gene with the ORFs of either URA4 or LEU2 (see Materials and methods). Complete deletion of SPA (both ORFs) did not affect the viability of S.pombe cells in rich (YE) or minimal (MM) media. Temperature had no differential effect on mutant and wild-type cell growth. Similarly, the growth rates, mating efficiencies and overall morphology of the knockout strains are apparently indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells (results not shown).
        In wild-type S.pombe cells the most abundant polyamine is spermidine followed by putrescine (Figure 3). Spermine and cadaverine are found in much smaller amounts. This distribution of polyamine content is very similar to that in other fungi for which polyamine concentrations have been measured (for references, see review by Tabor and Tabor, 1985). The effect of SPA deletion on cellular polyamine contents was examined in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells (Figure 3). The cellular concentrations of putrescine, spermidine and cadaverine (but not spermine) were higher in the knockout strains than in wild-type cells. The greatest effect was seen on putrescine and cadaverine content, with smaller effects on spermidine, presumably because eukaryotic ODC activity directly catalyzes decarboxylation of both ornithine and lysine to produce putrescine and cadaverine, respectively (Pegg and McGill, 1979), but subsequent regulatory events affect homeostasis of spermidine and spermine. The effect of inactivating antizyme on the polyamine contents in exponentially growing cells is modest (<2-fold in all cases). The effect becomes very pronounced in cells in stationary phase with up to 40- and 10-fold increases of putrescine and cadaverine contents, respectively, in the knockout strains.
        To test overexpression of SPA, two versions of the gene were cloned into pREP3 expression vector behind a strong, thiamine-repressible promoter (nmt1). One had the wild-type SPA sequence while in the second, ORF1 and ORF2 are fused in-frame. SPA wild type and an SPA deletion strain were transformed with each of the overexpression constructs. Derepression of the nmt1 promoter is a gradual process since it requires dilution of the intracellular pool of thiamine (the repressor) through cell division. After 2.5 days of exponential growth under derepressed conditions, yeast strains transformed with either SPA overexpression construct show significant increases in doubling time (Figure 4A). The growth inhibition is greater with the construct expressing the in-frame version of SPA and after prolonged incubation (5–7 days); these cells cease growth and accumulate in G1 as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). The fact that the in-frame overexpression construct, which differs by a single nucleotide from the wild-type construct, confers a more severe phenotype is consistent with the hypothesis that translational frameshifting is required for expression of SPA. The growth phenotype associated with SPA overexpression is only partially relieved by adding 100 µM putrescine to the media (1 mM had no further effect) (data not shown). To see whether the slower growth is correlated with aberrant polyamine levels the polyamine contents of the deletion strain carrying in-frame SPA overexpression vector were measured under derepressed and repressed conditions, in both cases after 2 days of exponential growth (Figure 4B). As expected, overexpression of SPA results in significant reduction in the intracellular levels of all four polyamines. After longer (4–5 days) incubation under derepressed conditions, no putrescine and cadaverine can be detected (data not shown).
      
      
        Translational frameshifting during expression of SPA
        Previously, we developed an assay for measuring antizyme translational frameshifting in both S.cerevisiae (Matsufuji et al., 1996) and S.pombe (Ivanov et al., 1998c). Briefly, the nucleotide sequence to be assayed is inserted between GST and lacZ, such that ORF1 of the assayed sequence is fused in-frame to GST, while ORF2 is fused in-frame to lacZ. β-galactosidase activity provides a measure of frameshifting efficiency. To determine whether translational frameshifting occurs in the overlap of ORF1 and ORF2 of SPA, a region of SPA including all but the first codon of ORF1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream of the ORF1 stop codon was tested. +1 frameshifting occurred at 2.2% compared with a construct in which ORF1 and ORF2 are fused in-frame. This result is consistent with +1 frameshifting being crucial for expression of SPA.
        Previous experiments have shown that the frameshift cassette of mammalian antizyme 1 can direct efficient +1 frameshifting when tested in S.pombe. The reverse experiment was conducted here. The SPA gene was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and its resulting frameshift efficiency measured. With no addition of polyamines, frameshifting efficiency is ∼1.5%. Addition of spermidine to the translation mixture to a final concentration of 1 mM results in a 3.7-fold increase in frameshifting to ∼5.5%, a level even higher than that observed in the endogenous system in vivo (autoradiogram not shown).
        The observed efficiency of frameshifting with the SPA frameshifting cassette in vivo in S.pombe is significantly more than that expected from its limited nucleotide similarity to the antizyme frameshift sites of higher eukaryotes. This prompted a search for additional stimulatory elements within the SPA frameshift cassette. The following experiments were done in a strain carrying deletion of SPA (high polyamines) because it gives higher frameshifting and higher β-galactosidase activity in general; however, we obtained similar ratios for mutant to wild-type frameshifting efficiency in a strain with the intact SPA gene. Deleting 5′ sequences up to the third to last sense codon of ORF1 has little or no effect on frameshifting efficiency. Deleting all but the last sense codon (UCC) of ORF1 leads to a 4- to 5-fold reduction in frameshifting efficiency (Figure 5A). This implies that the conservation of the six nucleotides 5′ of the UCC-UGA frameshift site is due to their importance for stimulating +1 frameshifting. It also suggests that no additional ORF1 sequences of SPA stimulate the +1 recoding event. The 180 nucleotide 3′ region was searched for possible structure by computer RNA folding algorithms plus visual inspection. The algorithms predicted several minimal structures in that region. 3′ deletion constructs (constructs del.3,3′–81,3′) tested the importance of any putative structure on the frameshifting efficiency. The results (Figure 5B and C) show that all of these deletions lead to a significant (∼10-fold) reduction in +1 frameshifting, indicating the presence of a major 3′ stimulatory element in the 180 nucleotide region immediately following the frameshift site of SPA. However, the results indicate that none of the putative RNA structures in this region are sufficient for the activity of this element. Several additional 3′ deletions delineated the boundaries of this stimulatory element from the frameshift site to 150 and 180 nucleotides downstream (since construct del.150,3′ stimulates 5.5-fold more +1 frameshifting than del.129,3′, 150 nucleotides downstream probably contain most of the 3′ stimulator).
        In the experiments described above, two of the characteristics of the autoregulatory circuit of mammalian antizyme 1 were confirmed: SPA inhibition of ODC and the +1 translational frameshifting. The key question left is whether the recoding event is responsive to polyamine levels in cells. As shown above, overexpression of SPA leads to significant reduction of polyamine levels in S.pombe. An SPA+ strain was co-transformed with an SPA wild-type overexpressing plasmid (cells overexpressing wild-type SPA grow slowly but continuously) and a construct that monitors the +1 frameshifting from an SPA frameshift sequence. The +1 frameshifting was compared with that in SPA non-overexpressing cells (in both cases frameshifting was measured relative to in-frame control). The results (Figure 6) show a significant reduction (6.5-fold) in frameshifting efficiency in SPA-overproducing cells that correlates with a decrease of polyamine content (4.5-fold for putrescine and 3.9-fold for spermidine). This indicates that polyamines modulate the frameshifting efficiency of SPA. An alternative but less likely possibility is that SPA overexpression reduces frameshifting because high levels of SPA transcript titrate some factor limiting for frameshifting.
        The SPA frameshift signals direct 2-fold more frameshifting in Δspa::LEU2 cells (4.4%) than in SPA+ cells (in both cases the measurement is done during stationary phase); however, the relatively high standard deviations for both measurements make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from this particular result.
      
      
        Identification of antizyme genes in nematodes
        A search of Caenorhabditis elegans expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences with mammalian antizyme 1 sequence identified 20 clones. These sequences could be deconvoluted into a contiguous cDNA sequence. Primers designed on the basis of this sequence were used to PCR amplify and subclone this cDNA from a C.elegans cDNA library. The sequence of the subcloned cDNA was confirmed (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217278); the subsequently released genomic sequence of this C.elegans gene (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF040659) confirms our cDNA data. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence revealed that the longer ORF has similarity to previously reported antizyme sequences (overall 27% identity, 39% similarity to human antizyme 1; 19% identity, 34% similarity to Drosophila antizyme). These similarities are higher than that of SPA to these two antizyme genes and again are concentrated in the regions most highly conserved among previously identified antizymes (Figure 1A). Just like mammalian antizymes, the longer ORF (ORF2) lacks an appropriate in-frame initiation codon, and expression could be provided by initiation in a short upstream overlapping ORF (ORF1) leading to +1 ribosomal frameshifting in the overlap. The putative C.elegans antizyme frameshift site (the nucleotides proximal to the end of ORF1) has 18 of 26 nucleotides identical to the consensus sequence for antizyme frameshift sites (Figure 1B).
        Frameshifting for expression of C.elegans antizyme was investigated in heterologous systems. Two constructs containing the entire antizyme cDNA, one with the wild-type sequence and one with a single nucleotide deletion that fuses ORF1 to ORF2 in-frame (in-frame control), were transcribed in vitro and the RNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The products were examined by SDS–PAGE (Figure 7). The main product from both constructs has an apparent Mr of 21 kDa, slightly greater than the predicted Mr of 17.7 kDa [aberrant, slower than expected, mobility is observed with antizyme proteins from other species (Ivanov et al., 1998a)]. From the ratio of wild-type to in-frame product, we estimate that the efficiency of frameshifting of C.elegans antizyme in reticulocyte lysate is ∼0.8%, which is somewhat lower than SPA frameshifting in the same system. Addition of spermidine to the translation reactions almost doubles the efficiency of frameshifting to ∼1.5% (the exact numbers are not easy to determine because of difficulty in defining background values). The frameshifting properties of C.elegans antizyme mRNA were also tested in vivo in S.pombe cells. A sequence including all but the first codon of ORF1 plus 180 nucleotides downstream was inserted between GST and lacZ of the PIU-LAC plasmid. Comparison of the β-galactosidase activity of cells (Δspa::LEU2 strain) transformed with the wild-type construct and the in-frame control constructs indicated 3.5% +1 frameshifting. From the frameshifting observed in the heterologous systems, as well as the sequence considerations discussed above, we conclude that expression of this C.elegans gene requires ribosomal frameshifting.
        Searching the EST database with the newly discovered C.elegans antizyme identified antizyme orthologs in four other nematode species. In two cases (Necator americanus and Haemonchus contortus), the cDNA sequences in the database were sufficient to make contigs of the complete coding regions. In the other two cases [Onchocerca volvulus (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217279) and Pristioncus pacificus (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession No. AF217280)] the complete cDNA sequences were obtained by PCR amplifying and sequencing the full genes from cDNA libraries. As with the previously identified eukaryotic antizyme genes, the ORF configuration of the newly found nematode orthologs implies the necessity for +1 frameshifting for synthesis of full-length protein.
        The C.elegans antizyme mRNA frameshift site UUU-UGA is unique, differing from the UCC-UGA of previously known antizyme mRNAs. The C.elegans antizyme gene shares this feature with N.americanus and H.contortus but not with P.pacificus and O.volvulus antizymes. The phylogenetic tree of nematode antizyme protein sequences matches exactly the phylogenetic relationship (Blaxter, 1998) of the nematodes expressing them, indicating that these gene sequences are the result of divergent evolution within the nematode lineage (data not shown). These results also show that the UUU-UGA frameshift site evolved after the last common ancestor of P.pacificus and C.elegans but before the divergence of C.elegans, N.americanus and H.contortus (probably 450–500 million years ago).
        The ability of UUU-UGA sequence to direct +1 frameshifting was further tested in a mammalian system in the context of the mammalian antizyme mRNA (i.e. in the presence of the 3′ RNA pseudoknot and 5′ stimulator). A BMV-coat-protein–antizyme 1 gene fusion construct, which has a TCC-TGA to TTT-TGA substitution, was transcribed and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Eleven percent frameshift efficiency was seen in the absence of exogenously added polyamines, 2.2 times the efficiency seen with the UCC-UGA transcript. The frameshift efficiency becomes 18% when 0.6 mM spermidine is added, which is 1.3 times that with the wild type (Matsufuji et al., 1995). Similar results were obtained in cultured mammalian (Cos7) cells transfected with TTT-TGA mutant construct, the frameshift being higher than that of wild-type construct in both high- and low-polyamine conditions (our unpublished results). These results demonstrate that the putative C.elegans frameshift site (UUU-UGA) is, if anything, shiftier than UCC-UGA in the antizyme 1 context and is subject to polyamine stimulation.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      The results presented show that the yeast S.pombe has a homolog of mammalian antizyme. This is the first documented example of antizyme-type regulation of ODC in a lower eukaryote.
      Deleting SPA from the yeast genome has no detectable effect on viability or any other overt phenotypic effect but, as expected, it results in altered accumulation of polyamines in the cell. Interestingly, the effect is most pronounced in cells in stationary phase, where the knockout cells accumulate up to 40 times more putrescine than wild-type counterparts. This compares with a <2-fold increase of putrescine in exponentially growing cells. A likely explanation for this observation is that the usual rate of ornithine decarboxylation in exponentially growing cells is close to capacity given ‘normal’ concentrations of substrate, enzyme and product. At the same time, all newly synthesized polyamines are continuously diluted through cell growth and division at a rate that is almost identical to the rate of maximum capacity synthesis. Cells in stationary phase can no longer dilute newly synthesized polyamines, and more importantly lack an effective antizyme- independent mechanism of shutting off ODC. This suggests that SPA is the primary regulator of ODC activity in S.pombe, not only during cell growth (short term regulation) but also in non-dividing cells (longer term regulation).
      Overexpression of SPA (5–7 days derepression) leads to complete depletion of intracellular putrescine. This result implies that in S.pombe ornithine decarboxylation is the only source of putrescine synthesis (the pathway from arginine via agmatine is not utilized). The complete depletion of cadaverine in SPA overexpressing cells suggests that ODC is the only enzyme in S.pombe that can decarboxylate lysine, which is also the case in rat tissues (Pegg and McGill, 1979).
      It is somewhat perplexing that addition of putrescine to the media leads to only partial relief of the growth phenotype associated with SPA overexpression. There are two likely explanations. (i) Perhaps S.pombe imports putrescine poorly. (ii) Alternatively, like the mammalian system, maybe SPA inhibits not only ODC but also the polyamine transporter. Further experiments will help to distinguish between these two models.
      It is unclear how widespread the antizyme gene is within the fungal kingdom. We have identified and cloned antizyme homologs from two other fission yeasts (Schizosaccharomyces octosporus and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus) and from two distantly related fungi (Botryotinia fuckeliana and Emericella nidulans) (our unpublished results). The antizyme frameshift site of the latter two fungi has evolved in a unique way different from all other known antizymes, but nevertheless even these two distantly related fungi have conserved the autoregulatory +1 frameshifting. The fact that the yeast S.pombe has an antizyme gene suggests the possibility that the higher eukaryotic metazoans may all have an antizyme gene.
      The only previously reported antizyme activity in unicellular organisms is from E.coli, but recent analyses suggest that E.coli does not have a true antizyme (Ivanov et al., 1998d). This makes SPA the first bona fide antizyme in a unicellular organism.
      The remarkable similarity of the core sequence important for antizyme frameshifting from S.pombe to humans could be due to convergent or divergent evolution. The near identity of this sequence in worms, Drosophila, Xenopus, zebrafish and humans argues against convergent evolution, as if antizyme frameshifting arose in a common ancestor perhaps more than one billion years ago.
      Three cis-acting RNA elements are known to stimulate mammalian antizyme 1 frameshifting. One is a 50 nucleotide sequence immediately 5′ of the shift site (Matsufuji et al., 1995; our unpublished results). A second stimulator is the UGA stop codon of ORF1 and the third is an RNA pseudoknot starting 3 nucleotides 3′ of the UGA stop codon. Among frameshift sites of the previously identified antizymes from mammals all the way to Drosophila, there is substantial similarity in the sequences immediately 5′ of the shift site. Sixteen of the last 18 nucleotides of ORF1 are completely conserved in these genes. Schizosaccharomyces pombe and C.elegans antizymes have 9 of 9 and 6 of 9 (14 out of 19 in O.volvulus) nucleotides identical to the consensus, respectively. For the 5′ sequences, generally, the more distantly related two antizymes are, the more the similarity is confined to the 3′ end of that region. Our SPA ORF1 deletion data show that mutation of nucleotides that are part of the 5′ consensus sequence leads to reduced frameshifting efficiency. This is another indication that conservation of nucleotide sequence in this region is because of its importance for stimulating efficient +1 frameshifting. It is quite striking that in all antizyme gene sequences identified so far, including a number of unpublished ones, ORF1 ends with a UGA stop codon. This is particularly surprising since any of the other two stop codons can substitute for UGA to stimulate antizyme 1 frameshifting, although slightly less efficiently, in vitro (Matsufuji et al., 1995) and in vivo (our unpublished results).
      The 3′ pseudoknot that stimulates frameshifting in antizyme 1 is highly conserved in all known vertebrate antizymes, including mammalian antizyme 2 (Figure 1B). None of the invertebrate antizyme mRNAs identified so far, including those presented here, has a sequence in the equivalent region that can be simply folded to a comparable RNA structure. However, sequences immediately 3′ of the frameshift site are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates. The conservation of this region between Drosophila and the vertebrate counterparts has already been noted (Ivanov et al., 1998b). The C.elegans antizyme gene contains the sequence YGYCCCYCA (Y = pyrimidine) in this region, which is identical to the consensus. The antizyme genes from the other four nematodes also have a similar sequence (Figure 1B). The significance of this similarity is not clear [in fact, sequences in this region appear to play no role in antizyme 1 in vitro frameshifting outside of the RNA pseudoknot context (Matsufuji et al., 1995)].
      Only two examples are known where RNA elements 3′ of the frameshift site stimulate +1 frameshifting. One is the RNA pseudoknot of mammalian antizyme 1 and the second is a short RNA sequence immediately following the frameshift site of Ty3 (Farabaugh et al., 1993). Additional examples would be very helpful in deciphering the role such elements play in the mechanism of +1 frameshifting. It is currently not known how many and which of the invertebrate antizyme genes contain 3′ frameshift stimulators. The results presented here show that an S.pombe 3′ stimulator enhances frameshifting ∼10-fold. This stimulator appears completely different from the 3′ RNA pseudoknot in vertebrates. Our deletion experiments indicate that none of the predicted RNA structures contained within the minimally required 3′ region [up to 150–180 nucleotides downstream of the frameshift site (Figure 5C)] are sufficient to confer the stimulatory effect. The SPA 3′ stimulator may act directly through sequence or may have an unusual RNA structure involving non-Watson–Crick base pairing. More detailed mutagenesis combined with phylogenetic analysis would be required to discern the nature of the 3′ stimulator of SPA.
      The nematode antizymes were analyzed for the presence of possible 5′ or 3′ stimulators flanking the core frameshift site. Computer RNA folding programs did not identify any potentially interesting structure. More importantly, phylogenetic analysis with the five identified nematode antizymes failed to identify any conservation of primary RNA sequence (or for that matter potential secondary structure) outside of the core region that is shared between two or more members. This could indicate that no such extra cis-acting stimulators exist in nematode antizymes or that they are located in a very different place within the mRNA, for example the 3′ untranslated region (the latter suggestion is not supported by our sequence analysis).
      A common mechanism for frameshifting is re-pairing of the peptidyl tRNA in the new reading frame. However, an alternative mechanism whereby the peptidyl tRNA merely occludes the first base of the next codon, has been documented for yeast Ty3 frameshifting (Farabaugh et al., 1993). Results of experiments with some mutants of the mammalian antizyme 1 shift site pointed to an occlusion mechanism (Matsufuji et al., 1995). However, the mechanism with the wild-type, UCC-UGA, shift site is not clear. For C.elegans antizyme the UUU-UGA sequence would be an obvious candidate for a re-pairing since Phe-tRNA could pair perfectly with UUU in both frames. But with UCC-UGA the Ser-tRNA first reading UCC could at best pair two out of three with CCU. This important problem warrants further investigation.
      The frameshift efficiency of SPA frameshift site is lower than that observed with mammalian antizyme 1 even when both are tested in the same organism (S.pombe) [for the frameshift efficiency of antizyme 1 cassette in S.pombe, see Ivanov et al. (1998c)]. It is possible that the observed efficiencies for S.pombe antizyme are artificially low because the constructs do not include all the cis-acting stimulatory elements. On the other hand there is no reason why a lower level of frameshifting does not correctly reflect the evolved balance with the other characteristics of the complex system such as relative protein stabilities.
      Like other core cellular processes, the antizyme polyamine regulatory scheme is conserved from yeast S.pombe to human. It is not obvious why this very special mechanism is so exquisitely preserved over vast evolutionary time. Perhaps there is another whole aspect to the system that our experiments do not yet detect. From this viewpoint it would seem very important to exploit the genetics systems of S.pombe and C.elegans to understand more thoroughly the physiological effects of perturbing the antizyme system.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        DNA manipulation and sequencing
        The SPA gene was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CAAAACAAGTTTTCATTATTGGTTTTTTTTAAATCAATCCCC (sense) and 5′-CGTAAATCCAATCTAAATTTAATCTTCAACTAAATCATGAAAAGCCTC (antisense). The S.pombe cDNA library used as a template in the amplification was kindly provided by R.Rowley (University of Utah). The C.elegans antizyme gene was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CCCAGGAATTCCTCGAGTATTTTGA GTATAATTTTAC (sense) and 5′-CGGCCGCTCGAGTTAGACCTT GTAGCTCATGATG (antisense). This same amplified DNA was used to make the constructs for in vitro transcription and translation of C.elegans antizyme by cloning it into pTZ18U plasmid using the SacI and HindIII sites incorporated in the two primers. The in-frame construct was made using a two-step PCR. The cDNA sequences of O.volvulus and P.pacificus antizyme genes were obtained by performing 5′ and 3′ RACE PCR with cDNA libraries, which were kindly provided by Ralf Sommer (P.pacificus) and Susan Haynes (O.volvulus). The SPA overexpression constructs were made by amplifying the gene with the primers 5′-GCATCCGAATTCCCAAATCCAAGCATCATACGCC (sense) and 5′-GCATCCGGATCCGCCAGTGTTCTTACTTTGAGA TGC (antisense), and then inserting BamHI-digested product between the MscI and BamHI sites of pREP3 plasmid. The in-frame construct was made by two-step PCR and subsequently all in-frame SPA constructs described below were made by one-step PCR using this plasmid’s DNA as a template. To make the constructs for frameshift assays in S.pombe, DNA fragments with a given nucleotide length (as described in the main text), were amplified from both the SPA and C.elegans antizyme constructs described above. These fragments were then cloned between the KpnI and BstEII sites of PIU-LAC plasmid (Ivanov et al., 1998c). The PCR primers included an ‘AC’ spacer between the 5′ cloning site (BstEII) and the antizyme sequences in order to correct the reading frame. The in vivo frameshifting assays in S.pombe (strains ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h– and Δspa::LEU2 ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h–) were done as described (Ivanov et al., 1998c). The plasmid for GST–SPA expression was made by PCR amplifying SPA (all but the first codon of ORF1 through the downstream ORF2) from an in-frame template and cloning the product into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pGEX-5X-3 plasmid. The antizyme frameshift site in the BMV-coat-antizyme fusion construct (C3NE) (Matsufuji et al., 1995) was mutated with a two-step PCR. To generate the two knockout strains, Δspa::URA4 and Δspa::LEU2, both ORFs of SPA were replaced exactly with the ORF of either URA4 or LEU2. To accomplish this, two pairs of primers amplified URA4 and LEU2 such that 50–60 nucleotides, which normally flank the two ORFs of SPA, flank the ORFs of the two genes. The amplified DNA products were gel purified and 2 µg of each were used to electroporate into ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M216 h– cells. URA+ and LEU+ transformants were selected by growth on URA– and LEU– media, respectively. PCR screen and partial sequencing, with primers flanking the regions used for the homologous recombination, confirmed the SPA disruptions. All DNA clones were sequenced with automated sequencing machines (ABI 100).
      
      
        ODC antizyme assays
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe ODC active crude extracts were prepared as follows: S.pombe (strain 1519, leu1-32, h–) provided by R.Rowley was grown to OD600 0.7 in 50 ml of minimal media + LEU. Ten milligrams of lysing enzymes (Sigma) were added, followed by continued incubation for 30 min at 30°C. Cells were harvested and washed once with cold homogenization buffer [25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 µM pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 2 mM EDTA] then resuspended in 0.75 ml of homogenization buffer. Cells were broken open and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4°C. Extracts were dialyzed overnight in dialysis buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT, 20 µM pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA). A volume of 25 µl of extract was used for each ODC assay. ODC activity was assayed by measuring the release of 14CO2 from l-[1-14C]ornithine (Amersham) as described (Nishiyama et al., 1988). Each reaction took 1 h. Pre-incubation of S.pombe extract with 0.1 mM difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) for 15 min led to >99% inhibition of 14CO2 release.
      
      
        Polyamine measurements
        The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then the pellet was frozen at –80°C until use. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS. An aliquot of the suspension was mixed with an equal volume of 8% perchloric acid, vortexed for 1 min, kept on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 15 000 r.p.m., 4°C for 5 min. Ten microliters of the supernatant were subjected to polyamine analysis using fluorometry on high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (Murakami et al., 1989). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).
      
      
        In vitro transcription and translation
        The experiments with the BMV-coat-antizyme fusion constructs were performed as described previously (Matsufuji et al., 1995). All other plasmid DNA templates were prepared using QIAGEN Miniprep Kit and then digested with HindIII. Transcripts for SPA in vitro translation were made from PCR templates that had a T7 promoter incorporated into the PCR primers. Linearized DNA (1 µg) was used as a template for in vitro transcription with Ambion MEGAshortscriptTM T7 Kit. The DNase-treated RNAs were recovered and resuspended in 40 µl of RNase-free water. One microliter of each specified transcript suspension was used in each in vitro translation reaction [0.5 µl of 1 mM amino acid mix –Met, 7 µl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.5 µl of [35S]Met (Amersham)] to a total volume of 10 µl. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 µl of RNase (10 mg/ml). The frameshift efficiencies were quantified as described (Ivanov et al., 1998a).

      Introduction
      p62 is a novel cellular protein which was initially identified in
 humans as a phosphotyrosine independent ligand of the src homology 2 (SH2)
 domain of p56
               lck 
            (1, 2). p56lck
 is a member of the c-src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that is
 found predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin (3, 4). In addition to the interaction with p56
               lck
            , p62 also associates with the Ser/Thr kinase (1, 2), atypical protein kinase C (5, 6), and ubiquitin (7). In addition to the SH2 domain, p62 possesses several
 structural motifs, including a ubiquitin associated (UBA) domain that is
 capable of binding ubiquitin nonconvalently (8, 9). 
      Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids that can be
 convalently attached to other proteins at specific lysine residues through
 chains composed of one (mono) or several ubiquitin moieties (poly). In addition
 to its classical role in protein degradation, ubiquitin is emerging as a signal
 for protein transport and processing (10-12). Conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires
 three enzymes: a ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
 E2, and a ubiquitin ligase E3. Initially, E1 activates ubiquitin by forming a
 high energy thioester intermediate with the C-terminal glycine using ATP. The
 activated ubiquitin is sequentially transferred to E2, then to E3 which
 catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between the activated C-terminal glycine of
 ubiquitin and e-amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate. Following the
 linkage of the first ubiquitin chain, additional molecules of ubiquitin are
 attached to lysine side chains of the previously conjugated moiety to form
 branched polyubiquitin chains. The fate of ubiquitinated substrates depends on
 the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated, as well as, the lysine linkage of
 Ub-Ub conjugation. The conjugation of ubiquitin to eukaryotic intracellular
 proteins is one way in which those proteins are targeted to the proteasome for
 subsequent rapid degradation. This mechanism is particularly important for
 short-lived regulatory proteins such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein
 kinase-inhibitors, p53, the nuclear factor kappa B precursor, and IkB (13). The ubiquitin-proteasome system consists of two steps: 1)
 the target protein is conjugated with polyubiquitin molecules, which mark the
 substrate for degradation; 2) the target protein is transferred to the 26S
 proteasome, unfolded and degraded. 
      The UBA domain is a conserved sequence motif among proteins that can
 bind polyubiquitin. It is comprised of ~45 amino acids (13). The amino acids 386-434 of p62, which bind polyubiquitin,
 has been shown to possess homology to other recently described UBA domains
 (9). Interestingly, proteins with UBA domains are more
 likely to bind polyubiquitin chains over monoubiquitin, such as the yeast UBA
 protein Rad23, a highly conserved protein involved in nucleotide excision
 repair (13). Recently, it has been shown that yeast
 cells lacking two UBA proteins (Dsk2 and Rad23) are deficient in protein
 degradation and that the UBA motif is essential for their function in
 proteolysis (14).
      In addition to the important role in recycling of amino acids from
 damaged or misfolded proteins, ubiquitin-protein conjugation also has functions
 unrelated to proteasomal targeting. For example, polyubiquitination is required
 for the internalization of several yeast and mammalian cell surface proteins
 into the endocytic pathway (15, 16). Interestingly, p62 appears to sequester ubiquitinated
 substrates into a cytoplasmic structure referred to as a sequestosome, into
 which excess ubiquitinated proteins are segregated (17).
 In addition, p62 is an immediate early response gene product for a variety of
 signals (18). Thus, p62 appears to play a novel
 regulatory role for polyubiquitinated proteins and may have an essential
 function in cell proliferation and differentiation. We have developed a method
 that will enable identification of protein(s) that interact with p62’s UBA
 domain.

                  expression cloning
               
        To search for novel proteins that bind to the UBA domain of p62,
 we performed in vitro expression cloning (IVEC) using the ProteoLink
 IVEC system. The human adult brain library 96 well plates with 100 cDNAs per
 well was transcribed and translated employing the Gold TNT SP6 Express 96 plate
 and [35S] methionine. The TNT Quick-coupled
 transcription-translation system contained a rabbit reticulocyte lysate
 pre-mixed with most of the reaction components necessary to carry out
 transcription/translation in the lysate, including all of the amino acids
 except methionine. [35S] Methionine was used to label newly
 synthesized proteins. The reactions were set up according to the
 manufacturer’s instructions. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate has been shown to be
 capable of carrying out ubiquitination of proteins that were translated in such
 an in vitro translation system (19, 20). The reactions mixtures also contained ubiquitin so that
 the newly synthesized proteins could be ubiquitinated. The reactions were
 incubated at 30°C for 2 hours. The resulting proteins were assayed to
 determine their binding ability with p62’s UBA domain. Potential positive
 “hits” were further subdivided and re-assayed to link individual clones to
 the protein of interest (Fig. 1).

        Each translated pool was resuspended in binding buffer (25 mM
 Tris pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40) and used as a source of protein in p62
 UBA pull down assays. Proteins that specifically interact with the UBA domain
 of p62 were isolated by interaction with agarose-immobilised p62-UBA peptide
 (amino acid 387-436 of p62) (5 mg) for 2 hours at 4ºC, then washed three times
 in washing buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40). Bound proteins
 were released by addition of SDS-sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The
 SDS-PAGE gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min, stained
 in 0.2% Commassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 15
 min, destained in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol overnight, and enhanced in
 autoradiography enhancer En3HANCE for 1 hr and exposed to X-Ray
 film. 
      
      
        Library Screening
        By combining 4 pools as one mixed pool, 96 protein pools were
 divided into 24 mixed protein pools for use in p62 UBA pull down assays.
 Positive mixed protein pools were selected and individual pools were retested
 for its ability to bind p62’s UBA domain. The individual cDNA pool from which
 the positive protein pool was generated was transformed into JM109 competent
 cells and plated on LB ampicillin plate. Individual colonies were chosen to
 grow overnight in 1 ml of LB media plus ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was purified
 from the cell culture and used for TNT Quick coupled in vitro
 transcription/ translation. The individual protein synthesized from each
 plasmid DNA chosen was screened for its ability to bind p62’s UBA domain. To
 confirm the interaction with p62’s UBA domain, the final resulting individual
 proteins were used in the coupled TNT/p62 UBA pull down assays. The cDNA
 inserts were sequenced in the Genomics Core Facility at Auburn University and
 the sequences were compared with known sequences in NCBI database by BLAST
 analysis.
      
      
        
                  Transfection and in vitro ubiquitination
               
        Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were cultured in high
 glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10%
 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and transfected with myc-tagged HSP70 plasmid
 using the Mammalian Cell Transfection Kit. Cells were harvested and lysed in 1
 ml of SDS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 0.5%
 TX-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml
 leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 1% SDS) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at
 14000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to remove the insoluble fraction. The protein
 concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein
 assay reagent with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Equal amount of
 protein (750 mg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc and collected with
 agarose-coupled secondary antibody. To the agarose beads containing the
 immunoprecipitated HSP70, 50 ml of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2.5
 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP) was added containing 100 ng E1, 200 ng
 E2 (UbcH7), and 100 mg of E3 (Flag-tagged TRAF6) along with 5 mg GST-WT-Ub,
 GST-K29R Ub, GST-K48R Ub, GST-K63R Ub, or K63 Ub. Control samples without
 HSP70, E1, E2, E3, or GST-WT-Ub were also included. Reactions were carried out
 by continuous shaking at 37°C for 2 hours and then washed three times with
 reaction buffer. The proteins were released by boiling for 2 min in SDS-PAGE
 sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for
 anti-ubiquitin.

                  transcription/translation
               
        To search for novel proteins that bind to the UBA domain of p62,
 we performed in vitro expression cloning (IVEC) using the ProteoLink
 IVEC system from Promega (Cat. No. L6500). The human adult brain library 96
 well plates with 100 cDNAs per well were transcribed and translated employing
 the Gold TNT SP6 Express 96 plate in the presence of [35S]
 methionine and ubiquitin (25 mg/ml, Sigma). By combining 4 protein pools as one
 mixed pool, 96 protein pools were divided into 24 mixed pools (Fig. 2A, 2B).
        
          Fig. 2
          
            Protein synthesized by the ProteoLink IVEC system in the

             96 protein pools were generated by employing
 TNT Quick Coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. The 96 protein
 pools were then divided into 24 mixed protein pools by combining four protein
 pools as one mixed protein pool. A: 1 day exposure; B: 3 days exposure.
          
          
        
        Each lane contained more than 100 proteins (theoretically 400)
 with different molecular weight. Therefore, each lane appeared as a smear,
 indicating that the in vitro transcription/translation system from
 Promega worked successfully. In order to examine whether proteins synthesized
 in the IVEC system are also ubiquitinated, Western blot analysis was performed
 by blotting the newly synthesized proteins (in the presence of cold methionine
 instead of 35S methionine) with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody. In
 the mixed protein pools, each of the 24 lanes appeared as a smear, indicating
 that proteins synthesized by the IVEC system are also ubiquitinated (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the IVEC
 system can utilize different lysine linkages of ubiquitin (i.e., Ub K29, Ub
 K48, and Ub K63) for ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). In order
 to investigate whether the agarose-immobilised p62 UBA peptide has binding
 specificity, a mixed protein pool synthesized by IVEC system was tested in a
 pull down assay in the presence of agarose beads alone or in the presence of
 p62 UBA agarose beads (Fig. 3C). Our results revealed
 that proteins that bound to p62’s UBA domain could not be pulled down by
 agarose beads alone, indicating that the agarose-immobilised p62 UBA peptide
 had binding specificity.

        p62 UBA pull down and library screen
        In order to identify proteins that bind to p62’s UBA domain,
 p62 UBA pull down assays were performed. Out of the 24 mixed protein pools,
 several pools contained [35S] methionine-labeled bands in the
 primary p62 UBA pull down assays (Fig. 4). We chose 6
 pools (pool # 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, 21) because of their stronger signal to
 specifically identify which individual protein pool in the mixed pools has the
 ability to bind to p62’s UBA domain. Therefore, a secondary screen was
 conducted on the 6 positive individual mixed pools (representing 24 individual
 protein pools) which bound with p62’s UBA domain (Fig. 5). Mixed protein pool # 2 generated a positive protein with
 molecular weight of 51 KDa (Fig. 4), and only individual
 protein pool “c” out of the four protein pools (a, b, c, d) that comprised
 protein pool #2 had a protein with the same molecular weight (Fig. 5). Depending on the size of the protein pulled down in the
 secondary screen compared to the primary screen (Fig. 4),
 individual protein pools “c”, “h”, “i”, “o”, “t”, and
 “v” were identified (Fig. 5).

            Pull down assay of p62’s UBA domain with proteins
 (mixed protein pool) synthesized by IVEC system in the presence of [35S]

             The 24 mixed proteins pools were incubated with
 agarose-immobilised p62 UBA beads for 2 hours at 4ºC and washed three times in
 washing buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling for 2 min in SDS-PAGE
 sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Positive “hits” were marked by
 arrows and the positive protein pools were selected for subsequent
 deconvulation.

             The 6 positive mix protein pools (# 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, 21 from
 Fig. 4) representing 24 individual protein pools were
 incubated with agarose-immobilised p62 UBA beads for 2 hours at 4ºC and the
 beads were washed three times in washing buffer. Bound proteins were released
 by boiling for 2 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE.
 Positive “hits” were marked by arrows and the positive individual protein
 pools were underlined.
          
          
        
        To specifically identify which protein in the individual protein pool has the ability to bind p62’s UBA domain, the cDNAs from the positive individual protein pools were then transformed into JM109 competent cells and plated out on LB ampicillin plates. Individual colonies were chosen to grow overnight in 1 ml of LB media plus ampicillin. Plasmid DNAs were purified from the cell culture and used for TNT Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation. The individual protein synthesized from each plasmid DNA was retested for its ability to bind p62’s UBA domain. By synthesizing individual protein from individual plasmid using the Gold TNT Quick coupled in vitro transcription/translation system and subjecting them to p62 UBA pull-down assays, 11 positive clones were isolated from the 6 positive individual pools. It is not surprising that 5 more clones showed binding ability with p62’s UBA domain since there are 100 cDNAs in each positive individual pool and some of them could have lower binding ability and therefore showed weak signal in the mixed protein pool. It is also possible that they are not as efficiently synthesized in the mixed TNT reaction as in the individual TNT reaction in which only one cDNA was used as template. The 11 positive plasmids were sequenced and compared with known cDNA sequences in NCBI database using BLAST analysis with results shown in Table 1.
        Interestingly, the proteins identified in the screen fall into three distinct categories. One set are proteins that are associated with Alzheimer’s disease, including myelin basic protein, 14-3-3 protein, syntaxin binding protein munc18, transketolase, heat shock protein HSP70, reelin, and calcium/calmodulin kinase II (Table 1). Significant decrease in the amount of myelin basic protein has been reported in the white matter of Alzheimer’s disease patients, accompanied by increased quantities of b-amyloid peptides (21). The presence of b-amyloid peptides containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the two major pathological features in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (22). Interestingly, 14-3-3 proteins have also been demonstrated to be components of neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer’s disease brains (23). Syntaxin binding protein munc18 can powerfully regulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism and b-amyloid secretion through direct and indirect interactions with X11 proteins (24). The activity of transketolase has been reported to be reduced in dementia of Alzheimer’s type brain (25). Heat shock protein HSP70 expression is significantly increased in the temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (26). Besides HSP70, other heat shock proteins are also linked with Alzheimer’s disease. For example, increased synthesis of HSP27 has been suggested to play a role in preventing neuronal injury in AD (27), and alpha-crystallin heat shock protein has a close relationship with neurofibrillary tangles of AD brains (28). Reelin is a large secreted protein that controls cortical layering by signaling through the very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2, thereby inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) and suppressing tau phosphorylation (29). Neurofibrillary tangles comprised of highly phosphorylated tau proteins are a key component of Alzheimer’s disease (30). Enhanced activity of calcium/calmodulin kinase II has been suggested to contribute to phosphorylation of tau protein and lead to neurofibrillary tangle deposition and neuronal death in Alzheimer’s disease (31). Although the relationship between p62 and neurofibrillary tangles or neuritic plaques is unclear, both neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neuritis of neuritic plaques are associated with ubiquitin (32), suggesting that dysfunction in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and the resulting accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins may contribute to the origination of dystrophic neuritis and neurofibrillary tangles. Furthermore, p62 has been recently reported to accumulate early in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (33), suggesting that p62 may play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease by interacting with those proteins through its UBA domain.
        A second set of proteins identified in the screen that bind to p62’s UBA domain are associated with brain development, including homeobox protein Meis2 and unc51 like kinase II (Table 1). Although Meis proteins are not extensively studied in humans, these proteins have been shown to be required for hindbrain development in the zebrafish (34). Unc51 like kinase II has been demonstrated to play a role in axonal elongation (35, 36), which is needed for the formation of complicated neuronal networks. The third set of proteins that exhibit ability to bind p62’s UBA domain are proteins that are linked with other neurodegenerative diseases, including FK506 binding proteins and nuclear receptor corepressor I (Table 1). FK506 (tacrolimus) is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in the treatment of patients after organ transplantation and in selected autoimmune disorders (37). FK506 is activated upon binding to members of the immunophilin family of proteins, which were designated as FK506 binding proteins (38). Immunophilins are chaperone proteins and FK506 binding proteins have been suggested as therapeutics for neurological disorders (39, 40). Nuclear receptor corepressor I has been suggested to play a role in Huntington’s disease because it is able to interact with huntingtin (41). The proteins identified here suggest that p62’s UBA domain has the ability to interact with multiple proteins that play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Further screening from the whole genome-wide perspective will be necessary to define the important role that p62’s UBA domain plays.

                  ubiquitination
               
        It has been reported that polyubiquitin chains assembled through lysine 48 of ubiquitin act as a signal for substrate proteolysis by the 26S proteasome (42-44). In order to understand whether the proteins identified in our screen bind to the p62’s UBA domain through lysine 48 (K48), polyubiquitin K48 chains were added to the p62 UBA pull down assay (Fig. 6). Inclusion of polyubiquitin K48 chains in the assay should compete for the binding of substrate to the p62’s UBA domain and reduce the interaction of those proteins with the p62’s UBA domain if those proteins are assembled through K48 chains. An alternative interpretation for polyubiquitin K48 chain competition is that the ubiquitin chains are competing for the same binding site as the binding partners which are either ubiquitinated or non-ubiquitinated. We randomly chose five proteins out of the 11 binding partners for the competition pull down (Fig. 6). Out of the five proteins, four proteins (# 2, 3, 4, and 5) showed reduced binding ability with p62’s UBA domain when polyubiquitin K48 chains were included (Fig. 6A, 6B). However, K48 chains failed to compete with HSP70, suggesting that p62’s UBA domain binds to HSP70 through a ubiquitin lysine linkage other than K48. Interestingly, it has been reported that heat shock protein 70 cognate (HSP70) is ubiquitinated by CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) via ubiquitin chain synthesis that uses either K29 or K63 (45). In order to examine which lysine linkage utilized by HSP70 binds to p62’s UBA domain, in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed by incubating lysates from HEK cells expressing HSP70 with E1, E2, and E3 in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP). As control, the ubiquitination of HSP70 utilizing the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was also investigated by Western blot analysis. Our results revealed that HSP70 was ubiquitinated in the IVEC system (Fig. 7A, 7B), and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contained enzymes such as TRAF6 (E3) and UbcH7 (E2) for in vitro ubiquitination (Fig. 7C).

             A: The individual proteins were synthesized by employing TNT Quick Coupled in vitro transcription/translation system and incubated with 5 mg agarose-immobilised p62 UBA beads +/- polyubiquitin K48 chains for 2 hours at 4ºC. The beads were washed three times in washing buffer and bound proteins were released by boiling for 2 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. B: The autoradiogram was scanned and the relative amount of protein (%) bound to p62’s UBA domain +/- polyubiquitin K48 chains was graphed. The amount of protein bound to p62’s UBA domain without addition of polyubiquitin K48 chains was considered 100%. 1: HSP70; 2: Meis2; 3: 14-3-3; 4: Reelin; 5: MBP.
          
          
        
        TRAF6 was chosen as an E3 in this in vitro ubiquitination assay due to its RING domain, a common feature of E3 ligases, and the observation that p62 is a scaffold for TRAF6 interaction (46). Therefore, in vitro ubiquitination assays using the E1-E2-E3 system were performed in the presence of either ubiquitin wild type or ubiquitin mutants (K29R, K48R, and K63R). If one lysine mutant blocks the ubiquitination of HSP70, it would suggest that the ubiquitination of HSP70 utilizes that specific lysine linkage. Our results revealed that HSP70 utilizes K63 linkage to assemble polyubiquitin chains to bind to p62’s UBA domain since only the K63R ubiquitin mutant blocked the ubiquitination of HSP70 (Fig. 8A). A similar result was also observed when reactions were conducted with wild type ubiquitin or mutant ubiquitin with all lysines mutated to arginines except K63 and the ubiquitination of HSP70 occurred only in the reaction that has either intact K63 ubiquitin or wild type ubiquitin (Fig. 8B). This finding is consistent with previous reports (45), demonstrating that HSP70 is K63-polyubiquitinated. Furthermore, the in vivo interaction of HSP70 and p62 was confirmed by transfecting myc-tagged HSP70 into HEK 293 cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and subjecting cell lysates to p62 immunoprecipitation and Western blot with anti-myc antibody (Fig. 8C). The interaction between HSP70 and p62 in vivo took place only when MG132 was included, suggesting that the interaction in vivo is dependent upon the ubiquitination of HSP70. The specific type of polyubiquitin chain recognized by p62’s UBA domain is not yet known and studies are underway lab to determine p62’s interaction with specific polyubiquitin chains, however, our preliminary studies suggest that p62’s UBA domain may recognize K63 linked polyubiquitin chains.

The reactions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with myc monoclonal antibody (bottom panel) to detect HSP70 or with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (top panel) to detect ubiquitination. B: myc-tagged HSP70 protein expressed in HEK cells was immunoprecipitated by myc-polyclonal antibody and used as a source of substrate for in vitro ubiquitination in the absence or presence of wild type ubiquitin or Ub K63R or Ub K63. The reactions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with myc monoclonal antibody (bottom panel) to detect HSP70 or with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (top panel) to detect ubiquitination. C: In vivo interaction of HSP70 and p62. Transfection of myc-tagged HSP70 into HEK293 cells was performed and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with p62 polyclonal antibody, followed by Western blot with anti-myc monoclonal antibody.
          
          
        
        In summary, for the first time, we demonstrate a systematic approach to identify UBA domain binding proteins from a proteome wide perspective. This approach could be readily adapted to high throughput screening. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins in the human adult brain that interact with the UBA domain of p62, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. This is a very interesting finding since 9600 cDNAs have been screened and only 11 of them showed binding specificity with p62’s UBA domain. Studies are underway to unfold the functional roles of p62 in the ubiquitin system. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain binding proteins at the level of the whole proteome, its application will unfold the important roles that p62’s UBA domain plays. This method could be easily adapted to identify proteins that interact with other UBA domains as well.

    The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic killed more people than any other outbreak of disease in human history. The lowest estimate of the death toll is 21 million, while recent scholarship estimates from 50 to 100 million dead. World population was then only 28% what is today, and most deaths occurred in a sixteen week period, from mid-September to mid-December of 1918.
    It has never been clear, however, where this pandemic began. Since influenza is an endemic disease, not simply an epidemic one, it is impossible to answer this question with absolute certainty. Nonetheless, in seven years of work on a history of the pandemic, this author conducted an extensive survey of contemporary medical and lay literature searching for epidemiological evidence – the only evidence available. That review suggests that the most likely site of origin was Haskell County, Kansas, an isolated and sparsely populated county in the southwest corner of the state, in January 1918 . If this hypothesis is correct, it has public policy implications.
    But before presenting the evidence for Haskell County it is useful to review other hypotheses of the site of origin. Some medical historians and epidemiologists have theorized that the 1918 pandemic began in Asia, citing a lethal outbreak of pulmonary disease in China as the forerunner of the pandemic. Others have speculated the virus was spread by Chinese or Vietnamese laborers either crossing the United States or working in France.
    More recently, British scientist J.S. Oxford has hypothesized that the 1918 pandemic originated in a British Army post in France, where a disease British physicians called ""purulent bronchitis"" erupted in 1916. Autopsy reports of soldiers killed by this outbreak – today we would classify the cause of death as ARDS – bear a striking resemblance to those killed by influenza in 1918 .
    But these alternative hypotheses have problems. After the 1918–1919 pandemic, many investigators searched for the source of the disease. The American Medical Association sponsored what is generally considered the best of several comprehensive international studies of the pandemic conducted by Dr. Edwin Jordan, editor of The Journal of Infectious Disease. He spent years reviewing evidence from all over the world; the AMA published his work in 1927.
    Since several influenza pandemics in preceding centuries were already well-known and had come from the orient, Jordan first considered Asia as the source. But he found no evidence. Influenza did surface in early 1918 in China, but the outbreaks were minor, did not spread, and contemporary Chinese scientists, trained by Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) investigators, stated they believed these outbreaks were endemic disease unrelated to the pandemic . Jordan also looked at the lethal pulmonary disease cited by some historians as influenza, but this was diagnosed by contemporary scientists as pneumonic plague. By 1918 the plague bacillus could be easily and conclusively identified in the laboratory . So after tracing all known outbreaks of respiratory disease in China, Jordan concluded that none of them ""could be reasonably regarded as the true forerunner"" of the pandemic .
    Jordan also considered Oxford's theory that the ""purulent bronchitis"" in British Army camps in 1916 and 1917 was the source. He rejected it for several reasons. The disease had flared up, true, but had not spread rapidly or widely outside the affected bases; instead, it seemed to disappear . As we now know a mutation in an existing influenza virus can account for a virulent flare-up. In the summer of 2002, for example, an influenza epidemic erupted in parts of Madagascar with an extremely high mortality and morbidity; in some towns it sickened an outright majority – in one instance sixty-seven percent – of the population. But the virus causing this epidemic was an H3N2 virus that normally caused mild disease. In fact, the epidemic affected only thirteen of 111 health districts in Madagascar before fading away . Something similar may have happened in the British base.
    Jordan considered other possible origins of the pandemic in early 1918 in France and India. He concluded that it was highly unlikely that the pandemic began in any of them .
    That left the United States. Jordan looked at a series of spring outbreaks there. The evidence seemed far stronger. One could see influenza jumping from Army camp to camp, then into cities, and traveling with troops to Europe. His conclusion: the United States was the site of origin.
    A later equally comprehensive, multi-volume British study of the pandemic agreed with Jordan. It too found no evidence for the influenza's origin in the Orient, it too rejected the 1916 outbreak among British troops, and it too concluded, ""The disease was probably carried from the United States to Europe .""
    Australian Nobel laureate MacFarlane Burnet spent most of his scientific career working on influenza and studied the pandemic closely. He too concluded that the evidence was ""strongly suggestive"" that the disease started in the United States and spread with ""the arrival of American troops in France .""
    Before dismissing the conclusions of these contemporary investigators who lived through and studied the pandemic, one must remember how good many of them were. They were very good indeed.
    The Rockefeller Institute, whose investigators were intimately involved in the problem, alone included extraordinary people. By 1912 its head Simon Flexner – his brother wrote the ""Flexner report"" that revolutionized American medical education – used immune serum to bring the mortality rate for meningococcal meningitis down from over 80% to 18%; by contrast, in the 1990s at Massachusetts General Hospital a study found a 25% mortality rate for bacterial meningitis. Peyton Rous won the Nobel Prize in 1966 for work he did at the institute in 1911; he was that far ahead of the scientific consensus. By 1918 Oswald Avery and others at Rockefeller Institute had already produced both an effective curative serum and a vaccine for the most common pneumococcal pneumonias. At least partly because of the pandemic, Avery would spend the rest of his career studying pneumonia. That work led directly to his discovery of the ""transforming principle"" – his discovery that DNA carries the genetic code.
    The observations of investigators of this quality cannot be dismissed lightly. Jordan was of this quality.
    More evidence against Oxford's hypothesis comes from Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger, well-known for his work extracting samples of the 1918 virus from preserved tissue and sequencing its genome. He initially believed, based on statistical analysis of the rate of mutation of the virus that it existed for two or three years prior to the pandemic. But further work convinced him that the virus emerged only a few months prior to the pandemic (personal communication with the author from J Taubenberger, June 5th 2003).
    So if the contemporary observers were correct, if American troops carried the virus to Europe, where in the United States did it begin?
    Both contemporary epidemiological studies and lay histories of the pandemic have identified the first known outbreak of epidemic influenza as occurring at Camp Funston, now Ft. Riley, in Kansas. But there was one place where a previously unknown – and remarkable – epidemic of influenza occurred.
    Haskell County, Kansas, lay three hundred miles to the west of Funston. There the smell of manure meant civilization. People raised grains, poultry, cattle, and hogs. Sod-houses were so common that even one of the county's few post offices was located in a dug-out sod home. In 1918 the population was just 1,720, spread over 578 square miles. But primitive and raw as life could be there, science had penetrated the county in the form of Dr. Loring Miner. Enamored of ancient Greece – he periodically reread the classics in Greek – he epitomized William Welch's comment that ""the results [of medical education] were better than the system."" His son was also a doctor, trained in fully scientific ways, serving in the Navy in Boston.
    In late January and early February 1918 Miner was suddenly faced with an epidemic of influenza, but an influenza unlike any he had ever seen before. Soon dozens of his patients – the strongest, the healthiest, the most robust people in the county – were being struck down as suddenly as if they had been shot. Then one patient progressed to pneumonia. Then another. And they began to die. The local paper Santa Fe Monitor, apparently worried about hurting morale in wartime, initially said little about the deaths but on inside pages in February reported, ""Mrs. Eva Van Alstine is sick with pneumonia. Her little son Roy is now able to get up... Ralph Lindeman is still quite sick... Goldie Wolgehagen is working at the Beeman store during her sister Eva's sickness... Homer Moody has been reported quite sick... Mertin, the young son of Ernest Elliot, is sick with pneumonia... Pete Hesser's children are recovering nicely... Ralph McConnell has been quite sick this week (Santa Fe Monitor, February 14th, 1918).""
    The epidemic got worse. Then, as abruptly as it came, it disappeared. Men and women returned to work. Children returned to school. And the war regained its hold on people's thoughts.
    The disease did not, however, slip from Miner's thoughts. Influenza was neither a reportable disease, nor a disease that any state or federal public health agency tracked. Yet Miner considered this incarnation of the disease so dangerous that he warned national public health officials about it. Public Health Reports (now Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report), a weekly journal produced by the U.S. Public Health Service to alert health officials to outbreaks of communicable diseases throughout the world, published his warning. In the first six months of 1918, this would be the only reference in that journal to influenza anywhere in the world.
    Historians and epidemiologists have previously ignored Haskell most likely because his report was not published until April and it referred to deaths on March 30, after influenza outbreaks elsewhere. In actuality, by then the county was free of influenza. Haskell County, Kansas, is the first recorded instance anywhere in the world of an outbreak of influenza so unusual that a physician warned public health officials. It remains the first recorded instance suggesting that a new virus was adapting, violently, to man.
    If the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no good explanation for how it arrived there. There were no other known outbreaks anywhere in the United States from which someone could have carried the disease to Haskell, and no suggestions of influenza outbreaks in either newspapers or reflected in vital statistics anywhere else in the region. And unlike the 1916 outbreak in France, one can trace with perfect definiteness the route of the virus from Haskell to the outside world.
    All Army personnel from the county reported to Funston for training. Friends and family visited them at Funston. Soldiers came home on leave, then returned to Funston. The Monitor reported in late February, ""Most everybody over the country is having lagrippe or pneumonia (Santa Fe Monitor, February 21st 1918)."" It also noted, ""Dean Nilson surprised his friends by arriving at home from Camp Funston on a five days furlough. Dean looks like soldier life agrees with him."" He soon returned to the camp. Ernest Elliot left to visit his brother at Funston as his child fell ill. On February 28, John Bottom left for Funston. ""We predict John will make an ideal soldier,"" said the paper (Santa Fe Monitor February 28th, 1918).
    These men, and probably others unnamed by the paper, were exposed to influenza and would have arrived in Funston between February 26 and March 2. On March 4 the first soldier at the camp reported ill with influenza at sick call. The camp held an average of 56,222 troops. Within three weeks more than eleven hundred others were sick enough to require hospitalization, and thousands more – the precise number was not recorded – needed treatment at infirmaries scattered around the base.
    Whether or not the Haskell virus did spread across the world, the timing of the Funston explosion strongly suggests that the influenza outbreak there did come from Haskell. Meanwhile Funston fed a constant stream of men to other American locations and to Europe, men whose business was killing. They would be more proficient at it than they knew.
    Soldiers moved uninterrupted between Funston and the outside world, especially to other Army bases and France. On March 18, Camps Forrest and Greenleaf in Georgia saw their first cases of influenza and by the end of April twenty-four of the thirty-six main Army camps suffered an influenza epidemic . Thirty of the fifty largest cities in the country also had an April spike in excess mortality from influenza and pneumonia . Although this spring wave was generally mild – the killing second wave struck in the fall – there were still some disturbing findings. A subsequent Army study said, ""At this time the fulminating pneumonia, with wet hemorrhagic lungs, fatal in from 24 to 48 hours, was first observed ."" (Pathology reports suggest what we now call ARDS.) The first recorded autopsy in Chicago of an influenza victim was conducted in early April. The pathologist noted, ""The lungs were full of hemorrhages."" He found this unusual enough to ask the then-editor of The Journal of Infectious Diseases ""to look over it as a new disease"" .
    By then, influenza was erupting in France, first at Brest, the single largest port of disembarkation for American troops. By then, as MacFarlane Burnet later said, ""It is convenient to follow the story of influenza at this period mainly in regard to the army experiences in America and Europe .""
    The fact that the 1918 pandemic likely began in the United States matters because it tells investigators where to look for a new virus. They must look everywhere.
    In recent years the World Health Organization and local public health authorities have intervened several times when new influenza viruses have infected man. These interventions have prevented the viruses from adapting to man and igniting a new pandemic. But only 83 countries in the world – less than half – participate in WHO's surveillance system (WHO's flunet website ). While some monitoring occurs even in those countries not formally affiliated with WHO's surveillance system, it is hardly adequate. If the virus did cross into man in a sparsely populated region of Kansas, and not in a densely populated region of Asia, then such an animal-to-man cross-over can happen anywhere. And unless WHO gets more resources and political leaders move aggressively on the diplomatic front, then a new pandemic really is all too inevitable.

      Microarray technology has been proven to be a powerful tool with great potential for biological and medical uses. In this technique, recombinant DNA fragments or synthesized oligonucleotides affixed on the surface of glass slides or nylon membranes are used for detecting complementary nucleic acid sequences (frequently representing a few hundred to >10,000 genes/expressed sequence tags) as well as for genotyping microorganisms and for profiling the gene-expression patterns in cells from higher organisms .
      A new report by Ghedin, et al.  in Retrovirology describes the successful use of a multi-virus array (termed multivirus-chip) to detect multiple viral co-infections in cultured cells as well as to study viral gene expression and promoter activities (Figure 1). Ghedin's multivirus-chip contains genes from eight human viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Conceptually, this chip can be used to detect viral co-infections in AIDS patients who are frequently rendered susceptible to additional opportunistic infections. In developing their multivirus-chip, Ghedin, et al. tested more than 250 ORFs from HIV-1, human T cell leukemia virus types 1 (HTLV-1) and 2 (HTLV-2), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6A (HHV6A) and 6B (HHV6B), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) which were PCR-amplified and spotted on glass slides. They then hybridized their slides with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled genomic DNA or cDNAs derived from various virus-infected cells. Their multivirus-chip was found to be highly specific and sensitive for detecting different viral genomic sequences in cell lines. Moreover, the chip could also detect the effect of various drugs on viral gene expression. In such instance, cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and KSHV were used to generate profiles of viral gene expression in the presence of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), Roscovitine, which was applied to cells to suppress the reactivation of latently infected viruses.
      
        Figure 1
        
          Schematic drawing of the multivirus-chip that possesses multiple functions. The multi-virus array used in the study conducted by Ghedin, et al. contains more than 250 DNA spots derived from PCR amplification of ORFs from eight human pathogenic viruses. These viruses include HIV-1, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, EBV, HHV-6A, HHV-6B, KSHV, and HCV. Depending on how the DNA targets are prepared, the multivirus-chip can be simultaneously used to detect viral genomic sequences, profile viral gene expression patterns, and investigate the relationship between cellular chromatin structure and viral gene transcription. Therefore, this multi-purpose DNA array is functionally versatile and would be very useful in both clinical diagnoses and biomedical research.
        
        
      
      Ghedin, et al.  also studied the role of cellular chromatin structure on viral gene expression using their multivirus-chip. They employed the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (ChIP)  to isolate cellular DNA fragments that were bound to phosphorylated histone H3 (P-H3). These DNA fragments were hybridized to the viral ORFs contained on the multivirus-chip to investigate the role of phospho-H3 on viral gene expression. They showed that whether transcriptionally active or silent the chromatin state played a role in regulating the expression of KSHV genes under the different cellular context.
      Current routine clinical diagnostics employ PCR, Southern blotting, Northern blotting, DNA sequencing and microarray hybridization to detect and characterize genes of interest in biomedicine. PCR is generally regarded as the most sensitive diagnostic method. However, Iyer, et al.  have shown that the sensitivity of cDNA-chip hybridization is comparable to that of TaqMan-driven quantitative PCR assay, and that the microarray hybridization technique is less likely to be complicated by high false positive rates due to carry-over contaminations. Furthermore, using microarrays, the viral gene transcripts in infected cells can be easily detected by hybridization without any prior amplification steps, and the microarray technique requires much less experimental material when compared to Southern or Northern blotting and can provide high sensitivity in the setting of large throughput.
      In view of the above, the multivirus-chip described in Retrovirology  holds several advantages over other more commonly used techniques (e.g. PCR, DNA sequencing) for the diagnosis of viral infections. First, this chip provides a more accurate diagnosis of viral infection by simultaneously evaluating the transcription of all viral genes, and can use such cumulative data to correlate infection with clinical disease manifestations. Second, the high throughput and flexible synthesis nature of DNA microarray construction can allow scientists to tailor-make and rapidly alter arrays to match evolving emergence of new pathogens. The SARS genome chip made by the US NIAID, NIH is a good example  of how diagnostic arrays can be developed quickly and be used in a timely manner.
      Finally, the most novel application described by Ghedin, et al. is their use of microarrays to correlate the cellular ""histone code""  with the promoter activity of KSHV. Usually the transcription of a gene located on chromosomal DNA is influenced not only by the cis-acting elements (or DNA-binding motifs), but also by the structure of chromatin. The latter can be vary depending on the post-translational modifications of histone proteins. Methylation, acetylation, and/or phosphorylation of certain amino acid residues at the amino terminal ""tails"" of histone H3 and/or H4 can indeed influence chromatin structure. Thus accumulating evidence has shown that chromatin-associated proteins and their modifications play vital roles in many physiological processes such as growth, differentiation, and development in mammals, plants and fungi . Many studies have used DNA array technology to investigate viral gene expression or to genotype viral isolates; however, none has used this technique to study the influence of cellular chromatin structure on viral gene expression . Ghedin, et al.  demonstrated that only DNA fragments derived from ChIP of latent BCBL-1 cell genomic DNA captured using phospho-H3 antibody bound specifically to the KSHV ORF on the multivirus-chip. This result suggests that latent KSHV genome in BCBL-1 cells is packed into a nucleosomal structure and that histone H3 proteins near the viral promoter can be phosphorylated at serines to make the DNA at the promoter region less tightly packed with histones and more easily accessible to transcription factors.
      In conclusion, the multivirus-chip improvements developed by Ghedin, et al.  provide versatile clinical and basic uses. In the near future, such chips are likely to be used to detect viral co-infections in many different clinical settings.

      Introduction
      In some critically ill patients, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is isolated from the upper or lower respiratory tract [1-15]. On the one hand, immunodepressed patients may be susceptible for transmission and acquisition of viral diseases, but on the other hand viral reactivation may occur and may contribute relatively little to morbidity and mortality. Indeed, reactivation of human herpes virus-6 is common in the critically ill and does not worsen outcome . In immunocompetent patients, however, isolation of HSV-1 may be associated with viral pneumonia, even if reactivation rather than primary infection is likely . Although HSV-1 has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia in the critically ill [1-14], either as primary or superimposed infection, there are only few reports that the virus has elicited an infectious host response, as demonstrated by a rise of serum antibodies, by bronchoscopic airway disease, by ""typical"" findings on computer tomography of the lungs, or by the presence of giant cells or nuclear inclusion bodies on cytology or biopsy of the lower respiratory tract . Indeed, Tuxen et al. observed that prophylactic antiviral therapy in ARDS prevented HSV-1 emergence but did not affect ventilatory days and patient outcome . The pathogenicity of the virus thus remains unknown, and the rare association between isolation of the virus in the critically ill and mortality may denote reactivation of the virus in immunodepressed patients with multiple organ failure and a poor outcome , rather than a symptomatic primary or superinfection contributing to death.
      Assessing pulmonary capillary protein permeability noninvasively at the bedside, yielding the pulmonary leak index (PLI), could help to judge tissue injury, as previously described [18-20]. This radionuclide method involves 67Gallium (67Ga)-transferrin and 99mTechnetium (99mTc)-red blood cells. In bacterial pneumonia, for instance, the PLI is elevated and the increase above normal directly relates to the severity of the pneumonia, expressed as the lung injury score (LIS) . In patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS in the course of bacterial pneumonia, the PLI is uniformly and greatly elevated above normal (up to 14.1 × 10-3/min) when LIS > 2.5, and in 80% of patients with a LIS between 1.5 and 2.5 and mild injury . Hence, the method yields a direct measure of permeability and an indirect measure of capillary injury in the lungs. The PLI is also elevated in interstitial lung disease .
      In order to help differentiating between symptomatic and asymptomatic viral shedding and spread, which could help to decide on antiviral therapy, and thus in assessing the pathogenicity of the virus, we measured the PLI in 4 consecutive critically ill patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin on ventilatory support, in whom a HSV-1 had been isolated.
    
    
      Patients and methods
      We report on a small series of consecutive patients, in whom respiratory secretions, sent for viral cultures, because of persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin, proved positive for HSV-1 (Table 1). Tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were directly transported to the microbiology laboratory or placed into viral transport medium (Copan Diagnostics Inc. Corona CA, USA). For isolation of HSV-1, specimens were inoculated in standard fashion in triplicate flat bottom tubes on human embryonal lung fibroblasts and incubated at 37 EC. Cultures were read three times weekly for 10 days for cytopathic effect (CPE). If CPE indicating HSV-1 appeared or blindly at day 2 and day 7, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) and typed by immunofluorescence with labelled specific HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies (Syva Mikrotac HSV-1/HSV-2 typing kit, Palo Alto, CA, USA). In the 4 patients reported, the results were available within 3 days after inoculation. On the day the specimen for viral culture was taken, demographic, chest radiographic and respiratory data were collected, as well as clinical features. In 3 of 4 patients on mechanical ventilation after intubation, the total respiratory compliance was calculated from ventilator settings, as tidal volume/(plateau – end-expiratory pressure), in mL/cm H2O. From the radiographic score (ranging from 0 to 4 depending on the number of quadrants with radiographic opacities), the arterial PO2/inspiratory O2 fraction (FiO2), the level of positive end-expiratory pressure and the compliance, the LIS , which ranges between 0 and 4, with values up to 2.5 denoting ALI and above 2.5 ARDS, was calculated. None of the patients had visible oropharyngeal vesicles.
      
        Radionuclide method
        To further characterize the persistent pulmonary infiltrates, the PLI was measured with help of a modification of the method described before . Since this is a routine procedure, informed consent was waived. Autologous red blood cells were labeled with 99mTc (11 MBq, physical half-live 6h; Mallincrodt Diagnostica, Petten, The Netherlands), using a modified in vitro method. Ten minutes after injection of the labeled red blood cells, transferrin was labeled in vivo, following i.v. injection of 67Ga-citrate (6 MBq, physical half-live 78 h; Mallincrodt Diagnostica, Petten, The Netherlands). Patients were in the supine position and two scintillation detection probes were positioned over the right and left lung apices. The probe system is manufactured by Eurorad C.T.T., Strasburg (Fr), and consists of two small cesium iodide scintillators (15 × 15 × 15 mm3) each in a 2 mm tungsten and 1 mm aluminum housing cover (35 mm diameter, 40 mm height). The front end of each probe has an aluminum flange attached (3 mm thick and 70 mm diameter), to facilitate easy fixation to the patient's chest with tape. Each probe weighs approximately 255 grams. The probe signals are led into a dual amplifier of which the output is fed into a multi-channel analyzer system connected to a personal computer. Since both probe have separate channels, there is no electronic cross-over. Starting at the time of the intravenous injection of 67Ga, radioactivity was detected every minute, during one hour. For each measurement interval, the entire spectrum of photon energies was stored on disk. During processing, the 99mTc and 67Ga count rates were corrected for background radioactivity, physical half-live, spill-over of 67Ga into the 99mTc window, obtained by in vitro measurement of 67Ga, and expressed as counts per minute (CPM) per lung field. At 5, 8, 11, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes after 67Ga injection, blood samples (2 mL) were drawn, from the cannula in the radial or femoral artery. Each blood sample was weighed and radioactivity of 1 mL of blood was measured in duplicate for each blood sample. Radioactivity measurements of these samples were done with a single well well-counter (LKB Wallac 1480 WIZARD, Perkin Elmer, Life Science, Zaventem, Belgium). The software automatically corrects for background, spillover of 67Ga into 99mTc and decay. Results were expressed as CPM/g. For each blood sample, a time-matched CPM over each lung was taken. A radioactivity ratio was calculated, (67Galung / 99mTclung) / (67Gablood / 99mTcblood), and plotted against time. The PLI was calculated, using linear regression analysis, from the slope of increase of the radioactivity ratio divided by the intercept, to correct for physical factors in radioactivity detection. By taking pulmonary blood volume and thus presumably surface area into account, the radioactivity ratio represents the ratio of extravascular versus intravascular 67Ga radioactivity. The PLI represents the transport rate of 67Ga-transferrin from the intravascular to the extravascular space of the lungs and is therefore a measure of pulmonary capillary permeability to transferrin . The mean of both lungs was taken. The upper limit of normal PLI is 14.1 × 10-3/min. Where appropriate, numbers are summarized as median (range).
      
    
    
      Results
      The Table describes the patient data. The patients had stayed for some period in the hospital or intensive care unit before HSV-1 isolation and had been admitted primarily because of respiratory insufficiency, in the course of pneumonia. Patient 4 was admitted into the coronary care unit a few days prior to intensive care unit admission for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. All patients were dependent on mechanical ventilatory support, for some period prior to sampling. They had received adequate antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and had ALI at the time of sampling, of otherwise unknown origin. The Table shows that the patients had radiographic abnormalities without an increased PLI. Central venous pressure was not elevated, arguing against overhydration as a cause of persistent pulmonary infiltrates. In patients 1 and 3 a high resolution computer tomography scan of the lungs with contrast was obtained, but the findings were nonspecific with alveolar consolidations and pleural fluid, even in the presence of some interstitial abnomalities with some ground glass appearance in patient 3. In patient 1, a bronchoscopy was performed and there were no mucosal lesions. There was a normal distribution of lymphocyte subtypes in the lavage fluid. A transbrochial biopsy revealed interstitial inflammation with many macrophage depositions, and immunohistochemical staining for HSV-1 was negative. There were no multinucleated cells nor cell inclusions observed, both in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patient 1 or the tracheal aspirates of the other patients. In patients 1 to 3, concomitant isolation of bacteria by culture was regarded as bacterial colonisation. Antibody testing was not done in patients 2 to 4, and proved positive for IgG anti-HSV-1 in patient 1, indicative of a prior HSV-1 infection. Antiviral acyclovir was started when cultures became positive, at a dose of 10 mg/kg TID, in two patients, at the discretion of the treating physician. Acylcovir was withheld in the other two patients, in the presumption that the pulmonary infiltrates were not caused by HSV-1, on the basis of a normal PLI, among others. In patient 1 with a normal PLI, a course of steroids was started the day after the PLI, and continued in spite of positivity for HSV-1, reported 5 days later. All patients survived until discharge from the intensive care unit.
    
    
      Discussion
      The 67Ga-transferrin PLI is a sensitive and specific measure of pulmonary capillary permeability, utilised for non-invasive severity assessment in a wide number of pulmonary conditions [19-21]. The PLI roughly parallels clinical severity, ie the LIS . Even though it involves relatively routine equipment, the diagnostic method has not gained wide application, partly because of its laborious nature . It carries the advantage of bedside measurements in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients, who cannot be transported easily. Pulmonary inflammation, of whatever cause, increases the PLI up to fourfold normal values in most severe injury, including ARDS. In less severe injury, such as impending ARDS and interstitial lung disease, the PLI is also, albeit less, elevated, as reported by us and other groups .
      The patients had a prior infectious episode in common, followed by a relatively prolonged period of respiratory insufficiency. They had persistent and nonspecific pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin, after treatment of their primary disease, prompting viral cultures. The normal PLI observed argues for a relatively harmless reactivation of the HSV-1, rather than a primary and damaging infection. In fact, critically ill patients with sepsis may have late immunodepression with lymphocytic apoptosis, lymphocytopenia, T-cell anergy, promoting viral reactivation . Apparently, the virus must have been latent in the nervous endings of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract in these patients . Herpes viruses have been relatively frequently isolated in vivo from respiratory secretions of patients with ARDS , and in surveillance cultures from the respiratory tract of patients after burns, trauma, transplantation, major surgery and others, but, fortuitously, in only 3% of lung biopsies of patients with prolonged and unresolving ARDS [3,7,9-13,15]. The literature thus is widely divergent on the precise role of the virus in pulmonary disease in the critically ill and its contribution to patient morbidity and mortality [1-15].
      We believe that the tracheal aspirates were representative of lower respiratory tract secretions, in the absence of herpes orolabialis and oral epithelial cells in smears for Gram stain of the secretions. The concurrent colonisation with other pathogens has been described before . Since there was no overlap in the duration of stay of the patients, transmission of the virus from one patient to the other can be excluded. This further suggests that respiratory HSV-1 infections in the critically ill may result from relatively harmless endogenous reactivation. Although the normal PLI argues against pulmonary parenchymal pathogenicity, tracheobronchitis caused by the virus  cannot be ruled out, even in the absence of orolabial lesions, since bronchoscopy was not performed in 3 of the 4 patients, even though being unremarkable in patient 1. The persistent pulmonary infiltrates in our patients may thus relate to slow radiographic resolution of prior bacterial or aspiration pneumonia, rather then superimposed infection. Moreover, computer tomography lung images may be largely nonspecific , so that the precise diagnostic criteria for HSV-1 pneumonia remain unclear. When properly standardized, for instance relative to cell numberd in bronchoalveolar fluid or tracheal aspirates, quantitative cultures, viral RNA and DNA by polymerase chain reactions, could be helpful in further studies to quantitate viral load, the ratio of replication to shedding and thereby the pathogenicity of the virus in the lower respiratory tract.
      In conclusion, our anecdotal data suggest that the isolation of HSV-1 from respiratory secretions in the critically ill patient with a persistent pulmonary infiltrate may warrant evaluation of tissue injury by the virus to judge its pathogenicity, for instance with help of a radionuclide PLI measurement, to help guide decisions on antiviral therapy, which may have adverse effects. In some patients, a low PLI may argue against viral pathogenicity and withholding acyclovir may be safe.

      Key messages
      • With help of gallium-67-transferrin and technitiumggm-red blood cells, a pulmonary leak index can be measured as an index of capillary permeability and lung injury. In 7 patients with HSV-1 from tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveloar fluid, the index was normal, suggesting low pathogenicity of the virus.
      • Low pulmonary pathogenicity of HSV-1 in the respiratory tracts argues for relatively harmless reactivation following immunodepression.
      • When pulmonary pathogenicity is low, antiviral therapy may be safely withheld.

      Background
      Concerns about intentional releases of smallpox have prompted extensive preparations to improve our ability to detect and respond to an outbreak of smallpox . Many factors contribute to the public health challenge of understanding and preparing for smallpox, including the age and quality of epidemiological data on native smallpox and the smallpox vaccine, the difficulty of extrapolating that data to our current populations, the possible terrorist use of altered smallpox, our ignorance of terrorist methods of release, and the relatively high risk of adverse events caused by the smallpox vaccine.
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established ring vaccination (selective epidemiological control ), a strategy in which contacts of cases are identified and vaccinated, as the preferred control measure in the event of a smallpox outbreak (interim plan). The successful use of ring vaccination during the smallpox eradication campaign and its logical emphasis of case-contacts for immediate vaccination support its use (though the attribution of the success of the eradication program to ring vaccination has been challenged ). Health Officers should initiate ring vaccination upon identification of the first cases of smallpox. However, there are legitimate concerns regarding the ability of public health practitioners to mount a quick, comprehensive and successful ring vaccination program, particularly in the face of a moderate-sized or large smallpox outbreak. To guide preparation efforts and inform incident decision-making, we attempt to identify outbreak characteristics and response capacities that significantly impact the ability of ring vaccination to control a smallpox outbreak and to determine whether ring vaccination is useful in the presence of a mass vaccination campaign. Our analysis uses a newly developed mathematical model: a continuous-time, event-driven network simulation model of smallpox ring vaccination.
      Mathematical models can advance our understanding of how a smallpox outbreak might progress. Several mathematical and computer models address the question of smallpox transmission [7-13]. The first model to appear  concluded that ring vaccination would be effective, but did not treat response logistics in detail; the model was linear and did not treat the depletion of susceptibles as the epidemic progressed (appropriate, however, for assessing control early in an epidemic, when the number infected is small compared to the number of susceptibles, e.g. ). The innovative model by Kaplan et al.  emphasized the importance of resource limitation and the logistics of smallpox response, but assumed that full infectiousness began before the onset of symptoms (and the subsequent identification and removal), and did not separately monitor close epidemiological contacts of patients (which are at greatest risk, but also easiest to find and vaccinate); the conclusions were highly critical of ring vaccination. The model by Halloran et al. , a stochastic, discrete-time network model omitted the explicit inclusion of response logistics while otherwise used parameter values similar to those in Kaplan et al. ; the inclusion of residual immunity from individuals vaccinated prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, however, led to a more favorable view of ring vaccination. The model by Bozzette et al.  assumed that ring vaccination would reduce the number of transmissions and focused on health care workers (but did not explicitly include the network structure of the population nor the response logistics of ring vaccination). The model by Eichner  did not explicitly include the network structure of the population nor the logistics of ring vaccination, but did use parameters based on data from an outbreak in Nigeria, and did distinguish close and casual contacts, case isolation, and surveillance of contacts; it concluded that case isolation and contact tracing could prevent the spread of smallpox. Finally, the individual-based model by Epstein et al.  presented scenarios illustrating certain alternatives to pure mass vaccination and ring vaccination of contacts of cases in preventing smallpox transmission in small populations of 800 individuals; this model includes no homogeneity assumptions, but did not analyze tracing of contacts of contacts.
      Because none of the available models includes both network structure (with explicit contact tracing) and response logistics limited by the number of available disease control investigators , we included these features in a continuous-time event-driven network simulation model of smallpox ring vaccination. Specifically, the model we developed includes the following features:
      
        Network structure
        Smallpox was primarily a disease of close contact, especially household contacts . Such contacts are both the most important epidemiologically, and also the easiest to identify.
      
      
        Post-exposure vaccination
        Some evidence suggests that vaccination soon after exposure may lessen the severity of the resulting case of smallpox or possibly prevent disease entirely [17-20].
      
      
        Second ring
        Ring vaccination may involve not only vaccinating contacts of cases, but also contacts of contacts of cases  – potentially allowing the public health authorities to ""outrun"" the chain of transmission.
      
      
        Response capacity
        Limited case-finding and vaccination capabilities lead to the possibility that it may be impossible to find newly exposed individuals and vaccinate them in time, resulting in a ""race to trace"" .
      
      
        Heterogeneity in natural history
        Mild, ambulatory cases of smallpox may spread disease because such cases may be harder to recognize.
      
      
        Prior vaccination
        Vaccination of individuals prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination may provide some, possibly considerable, protection against infection , although it may also result in more mild cases which may be harder to detect.
      
      
        Public awareness
        Public awareness may lead to more rapid detection of cases.
        We use this model to determine what factors promote or hinder the success of ring vaccination during a smallpox outbreak, and whether ring vaccination is useful in the presence of a mass vaccination campaign. In particular, the goal of this paper is to examine the control of smallpox by contact tracing and ring vaccination using a network model which includes response logistics .

          Natural history of smallpox
          We briefly review relevant features of the natural history and epidemiology of smallpox . Following infection by the variola virus, individuals exhibited an incubation period of approximately 7–19 days with 10–14 being most typical. Sudden onset of fever and malaise, often with accompanying headache and backache, began the initial (or pre-eruptive) phase of smallpox. After 2–3 (or perhaps 4) days, individuals with the most common form, ordinary type smallpox, developed the characteristic focal rash, preceded in many cases by oropharyngeal lesions. In fatal cases of ordinary smallpox, death often occurred between the tenth and sixteenth day of symptoms; among survivors, most scabs had separated by day 22–27 of illness .
          The course of smallpox varied widely between individuals, and several different clinical classifications were developed [29-31,17,26]. Consideration of the clinical features and severity of smallpox is important from the standpoint of mathematical transmission modeling because (1) the clinical features affect the ease of diagnosis (and thus of case identification), (2) more severe forms of smallpox may result in more transmission, (3) vaccinated individuals may develop less severe disease. We utilize a modified or simplified version of the classification system developed by Rao ; for the mathematical model, we will classify smallpox into five categories: early hemorrhagic, flat and late hemorrhagic, ordinary, modified, and mild. However, the clinical features and severity of smallpox in different populations may have been affected by underlying host factors, differences in viral strains, or differences in the infectious dose owing to different prevailing modes of transmission, and thus robust and precise quantitative estimates of the effects of (pre- or post-exposure) vaccination on the resulting smallpox severity, or of the infectivity differences between individuals exhibiting different forms of smallpox, are not available. The significance of such differences will be revealed through sensitivity analysis. Further details are given in Appendix 1 [see Additional file: 1].
          Vaccination with vaccinia virus provided substantial protection against infection. Dixon assessed the risk of infection for an individual successfully vaccinated 3 years prior to exposure to be 0.1% the infection risk of an unvaccinated individual . However, smallpox vaccination did not always take when applied, and moreover, in many instances, individuals who experienced a repeated vaccination failure developed severe smallpox upon exposure. The probability of a successful take depended on the vaccination method used; we assume that the take rate is between 95% and 100% . In addition to protection against infection, vaccination could in many cases modify the course of infection and reduce the severity. Vaccine protection waned over time, but individuals vaccinated 20 years prior to exposure were believed to still have half the infection probability that an unvaccinated person had , and to have some protection against the most severe manifestations of smallpox. Dixon  believed that vaccine protection had at least three components, which decayed at different rates; for the purpose of this paper, we will assume that the severity of smallpox in previously any (recently or otherwise) vaccinated individuals follows the same distribution as for the vaccinated subjects seen in the case series observed by Rao in Madras , except that anywhere from 0 to 5% of vaccinated subjects develop smallpox too mild to diagnose without special surveillance or awareness. Observe that the vaccinated cases studied by Rao were vaccinated (at some point in their lives) before exposure, rather than after exposure to smallpox.
          Smallpox was largely a disease of close contacts , spread primarily through face to face contact with an infected person (or occasionally through contaminated clothing). Individuals in the incubation period of smallpox were not infectious, and long term carriers did not exist. Patients were believed to be infectious following the development of oropharyngeal lesions, which could precede the rash by 24 hours . However, patients were believed to be most infectious during the first week of the rash ; Dixon (1962) believed that patients could be infectious from the onset of acute viremia, but most evidence suggested that little transmission occurred prior to the development of the rash . The more severe the case, the more infectious they appeared to be ; mild cases were believed to have very little infectiousness. While scabs contained infectious material and patients were considered to be infectious until the last scab fell off, in practice patients were not highly infectious during the scabbing phase. Importantly, patients who had been vaccinated were found to cause fewer secondary cases . Very severe cases, such as hemorrhagic or flat smallpox, occasionally resulted in considerable transmission, owing to diagnostic difficulties; mild cases, in which the patient remained ambulant during the course of the disease, could cause considerable spread as well . Within a household or family dwelling, the secondary attack rate of unvaccinated susceptibles depended on the time and place, occasionally below 50% , but often approaching 100% . Drier conditions were often believed to favor transmission , so that lower rates of transmission derived from tropical regions may not be applicable to the temperate zone . The number of secondary cases resulting from a given importation into Europe varied widely , with most importations yielding few cases, but with the occasional large outbreak being seen.
          Mathematically, we represent the course of smallpox according to Figure 1. We distinguish eight epidemiologically relevant states: (1) just following exposure, during which time vaccination could afford complete protection against disease, (2) a period of several days during which vaccination will not prevent disease, but may still reduce the severity of disease, (3) still prior to the development of symptoms, but too late for vaccination, (4) the beginning of the pre-eruptive period, during which the patient exhibits fever, malaise, and possibly other symptoms, but is not yet infectious, (5) a short period prior to the appearance of the rash, during which the appearance of oropharyngeal lesions will permit variola transmission, (6) the first week of the rash, during which time the patient is most infectious, (7) and (8), succeeding stages of the rash, during which time the patient is less infectious. For each of these states, we assume that conditional on surviving, the waiting time until the next stage is chosen from a uniform distribution as indicated in Appendix 2 [see Additional file: 2], except that the incubation period (the time from infection until Stage 4) is derived from estimates of the incubation distribution of smallpox based on importation cases in Europe  (see Appendix 2 [see additional file 2] for details). We chose to sample from a uniform distribution as a simple way to ensure a minimum waiting time in each state; many alternatives to this choice are possible.
          
            Figure 1
            
              Smallpox stages used in the simulation model. Flat and ordinary smallpox rashes are indicated with more dots than modified and ""mild"" smallpox, suggesting potentially greater infectiousness. Hemorrhagic smallpox is indicated by horizontal line shading. Further details are provided in Table 6.
            
            
          
        
        
          Network structure
          We simulate the transmission of smallpox on a ""small-worlds"" network (highly clustered, but with short characteristic path lengths) . Specifically, we assume that each person is located in a single household, and that the transmission rates were greatest in the household. We also assume that a fraction of the population are grouped into workplace or social groups, in which transmission may also occur, but with a lower rate per unit time than for household contacts. Finally, we assume that with a still smaller probability, any individual may transmit infection to any other individual in the population (casual contacts).
          In general, in a network-structured model, the number of secondary cases caused by an index case in a completely susceptible population is not a useful index of epidemic potential  (for a simple example, see ), since (for instance) an individual could infect everyone in his or her household, and not cause a widespread epidemic unless between-household transmission were sufficiently frequent. Rather than constructing the appropriate generalized basic reproduction number for our model (leading to highly cumbersome expressions), we chose an alternative (ad hoc) index of epidemic potential. For any given scenario of interest, we simulated the introduction of 10 index cases at random into a population of size 10000, and operationally defined ""containment"" to occur whenever the final size of the epidemic was less than 500 cases within 250 days (we showed, in the discussion of Figure 5A below, that in nearly all cases, the 250-day window differs very little from a 1000-day window). Because we simulate a disease with a finite duration on a finite and non-renewing population, epidemic extinction always occurs in finite time.
          
            Figure 5
            
              5A - The mean containment probability increases as the number of ring vaccinations per day is increased. For this figure, the 1000 ""calibrated"" parameter sets were chosen, and for each parameter set, 100 realizations were simulated and the fraction of these for which the epidemic was contained to fewer than 500 cases was determined. The average of these 1000 containment fractions is plotted on the vertical axis. We assumed a household contact finding probability of 95% and that the diagnosis rates double after community awareness of the epidemic. We considered high levels of workplace/social (w/s) contact finding (0.9), as well as moderate levels (0.8). We also considered two levels of diagnosis of smallpox among investigated (alerted) contacts: high levels (corresponding to a 3 hour mean delay, indicated by ""high contact isolation""), and moderate levels (corresponding to a one day delay, and indicated by ""less contact isolation""). The figure shows four such conditions, a. high workplace/social contact finding probability and high contact isolation, b. moderate workplace/social contact finding probability and high contact isolation, c. high workplace/social contact finding probability and less contact isolation, and d. moderate workplace/social contact finding probability and less contact isolation. All other parameter values were chosen from the uncertainty analysis (the 1000 ""calibrated"" parameter sets). In this figure, ""contact isolation"" refers to the monitored diagnosis rate, i.e. the rate at which previously asymptomatic contacts who subsequently develop disease will be diagnosed (φ, Table 1, Table 8).

              5B - The minimum containment probability out of the same 1000 scenarios chosen in Figure 5A. Whereas in Figure 5A, we averaged the simulated containment frequency (out of 100 realizations for each scenario), in this figure we determined which of the 1000 scenarios led to the lowest containment frequency, and we plotted this single worst (out of 1000) containment frequency, at different levels of ring vaccination capacity, for the same four conditions as in Figure 5A: a. high workplace/social contact finding probability (0.9) and high contact isolation (effective 3 hour delay following symptoms), b. moderate workplace/social contact finding probability (0.8) and high contact isolation, c. high workplace/social contact finding probability (0.9) and less contact isolation (effective one day delay), and d. moderate workplace/social contact finding probability (0.8) and less contact isolation. All parameters are the same as in Figure 5A (the household contact finding probability is 0.95 for all scenarios, and the diagnosis rates are doubled after the onset of community awareness). In this figure, ""contact isolation"" refers to the monitored diagnosis rate, i.e. the rate at which previously asymptomatic contacts who subsequently develop disease will be diagnosed (φ, Table 1, Table 8).
            
            
          
        
        
          Medical and public health intervention
          We assume that even in the absence of specific case investigations, the presence of smallpox symptoms will prompt patients to be diagnosed; we assume, however, a higher diagnosis rate for all forms of ordinary smallpox than for the severe flat and hemorrhagic forms, or for the mildest form. We assume that once an individual is diagnosed, their household and workplace contacts are investigated and detected with some probability; we assume that a high fraction (such as 95%) of household contacts are assumed to be traceable (see below). We assume that the fraction of workplace/social contacts that are traceable is less than the fraction of household contacts that are traceable; we assume that no casual contacts are traceable.
          High contact-finding rates may be plausible; we examined San Francisco Department of Public Health records of contact investigations for meningococcal disease (like smallpox, a potentially fatal disease for which rapid intervention may prevent mortality and morbidity). Records were available from December 2001 to April 2002; 13 such investigations during this period resulted in identification of 62 household contacts, all of which were contacted; out of 38 workplace/social contacts identified, 32 were contacted (84%).
          In our model, we assume that identified asymptomatic contacts are vaccinated, quarantined, and monitored for symptom development, while symptomatic patients are isolated and treated as necessary ; thus, the modeled interventions include more than ring vaccination alone. Finally, we include the possibility that all contacts (of both symptomatic and asymptomatic) traced and the same procedure applied, so that all contacts of contacts would be investigated. We assume that uninfected or asymptomatic individuals who are visited or traced individuals will be diagnosed more rapidly than if they had not been traced; in fact, such individuals would be isolated and would not be able to continue a chain of transmission. We follow previous models  in assuming a limited vaccination capability of Kr per day for ring vaccination. We assumed one of two strategies for contact tracing: (1) tracing only of direct contacts of diagnosed cases, and (2) tracing of contacts of contacts of diagnosed cases as well as direct contacts.
          The contact structure of the network is illustrated in Figure 2. Observe that individuals b and c are household contacts of individual a, so that if individual a were a smallpox case, an attempt would be made to find and vaccinate individuals b and c as household contacts of a case. If individuals a and b were both cases, then two attempts could be made to find individual c. We have modeled the effect of multiple contact-finding attempts conservatively in the sense that if the first attempt to find an individual as a household contact (of a case or of a contact) is determined to fail, no further attempts will be made. This maintains the failure rate of contact tracing (looked at from the standpoint of finding individuals) even in large households. Similar considerations apply to workplace/social groups.
          
            Figure 2
            
              Network structure shown for households (joined by thick lines) of size 3 and workplace/social groups of size 4 (joined by thin lines); a small portion of the network is shown. Individual a has two household contacts (b and c), and three workplace/social contacts (d, e, and f). If individual a were a smallpox case, the household contacts would be at highest risk for acquiring smallpox, followed by workplace/social contacts; all individuals in the population are at a low risk of casual transmission from individual a. Case investigation of individual a would identify the direct contacts b-f with probabilities that depend on whether the contact is household or workplace/social; if such individuals are identified, they will be vaccinated. If contacts of contacts are being traced, the investigation will subsequently identify individuals g-p.
            
            
          
        
      
      
        Analysis
        We analyzed the model in three ways. First, we selected a Latin Hypercube sample [44-46] of parameters chosen uniformly from the parameter ranges given in Appendix 2 [see additional file 2], and simulated the transmission and control of smallpox to determine which parameters were most important for contact tracing and ring vaccination to be effective. Second, we used the same Latin Hypercube Sample of input parameters, but assumed that all disease control efforts were inactive. We used these parameters to simulate smallpox transmission, but then iteratively selected transmission parameters so that (1) between 1% and 10% of new infections resulted from casual (random) transmission, and (2) each index case resulted in between two and five secondary cases (thought to be plausible for historic smallpox;  suggest three secondary cases). For each of the resulting smallpox parameter sets using 100 stochastic simulations per set, we determined the daily ring vaccination/case tracking capacity needed to contain all simulated smallpox epidemics (i.e., keep the total number of cases below 500 within 250 days). Third and finally, we chose parameter values to yield an moderately large smallpox epidemic (with each index case causing approximately six secondary cases), and present illustrative scenarios for ring vaccination. These scenarios are intended to complement the simulations which were calibrated to historic smallpox, since the characteristics of smallpox that may be used in a deliberate release are not known. It is important to realize that in our model, the case finding time determines the fraction of contacts that will become infected, and that our model parameters have been chosen to yield quite rapid transmission to close contacts; in reality, much transmission of natural smallpox occurred through ""sickbed"" routes which would not occur in a modern setting , so that in this sense our model errs considerably on the side of caution and pessimism.

        Most important parameters (sensitivity analysis)
        To determine which of the input parameters were most important in determining the total number of smallpox cases, we selected a Latin Hypercube sample of size 1000 from the input parameter ranges indicated in Appendix 2 [see additional file 2] and simulated the mean number of cases within 250 days in a population of 10000. We then computed the partial rank correlation coefficient  (PRCC; see Appendix 2 [see additional file 2]) between each input parameter and the number of smallpox cases; when the PRCC is close to zero, the value of the parameter has little relation to the simulation output; when the PRCC is close to +1.0 or -1.0, the value of the parameter is highly important in determining the simulation output. Neglecting the number of index cases (which is directly related to the number of new cases), those parameters whose PRCC exceeds 0.1 are shown in Table 2. Most of these parameters identified as important are related to the density of available contacts (mean household size, prior vaccination fraction, and protection due to prior vaccination) or the transmission rate and infectivity (including the length of the pre-eruptive infectious period (stage 5 in Figure 2)). Note, however, that the speed of ring vaccination (household tracing delay) and faster diagnosis due to awareness of the outbreak are important parameters. Additionally, the infectivity of mild cases appears as an important parameter as well.

        Illustrative scenarios
        To explore factors which contribute to the success of ring vaccination, we chose smallpox scenarios which resulted in severe and fast-moving epidemics in the absence of disease control; these simulated epidemics are considerably more severe than is believed likely under present circumstances.
        
          Effect of contact tracing and ring vaccination
          We used these parameters to simulate smallpox epidemics beginning with 10 cases, for a variety of levels of ring vaccination capacity per day (contact tracing capacity per day), as shown in Figure 3A. In this Figure, we assume that the population size is 10000, and that the epidemic began with 10 infected individuals. The mean household size is assumed to be 4, the mean size of the workplace/social contact group is 8, and contacts of contacts are traced. We assume that each day, the number of contacts that can be traced and vaccinated as a result of case investigation is 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 per day; the probability of finding a workplace/social contact is assumed to be 80%. The Figure shows the average number of infected individuals each day (based on 100 stochastic simulations) for each of these scenarios. Selected parameter values are indicated in the caption for Figure 3A and in Table 1.
          
            Figure 3
            
              3A - Expanding severe smallpox epidemic beginning with 10 initial cases, assuming 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 possible ring vaccinations per day. The household size is 4 and the workplace/social group size is 8; we assume 95% of household contacts are traceable (with a mean delay of 1 day) and 80% of workplace/social contacts are traceable (with a mean delay of 2 days). We also assume that 25% of the population have 50% protection from infection resulting from vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination. We assume that infection will be transmitted to close contacts with a mean time of 0.2 days, and that each person while infective causes on average 0.15 casual (untraceable) infections per day. We assume that individuals are 20% as infectious in the day just before the appearance of the rash as they will be during the first week of the rash, and that individuals are 20% as infectious as this (4% as infectious as during the first week of the rash) during the prodromal period. We assume that diagnosis rates will increase by a factor of 50% after smallpox becomes known to the community; we assume that each individual contacted during an investigation has a additional diagnosis or removal rate of 0.75 per day following the onset of symptoms (reflecting enhanced surveillance or contact isolation). Important parameters are summarized in Table 1; the full set of parameter choices is outlined in Tables 8-11 in Appendix 2 [see additional file 2]. Diagnosis times are discussed in Appendix 2 [see additional file 2].
              3B - An expanding severe smallpox epidemic under inadequate ring vaccination is shown for parameters identical to Figure 3A, except that workplace/social group sizes are 12 (instead of 8), and the probability of tracing workplace/social contacts is 0.6 (instead of 0.8).
              3C - A severe smallpox epidemic is controlled by ring vaccination despite the large number of initial cases. The parameters are identical to Figure 3A, except that 1000 index cases inaugurate the attack in these scenarios (and ring vaccination capacity is much greater, as indicated). While not recommended, ring vaccination may ultimately halt epidemics beginning with many index cases if sufficient vaccination capacity were available, contact finding feasible, and follow-up sufficient. 
              3D - Tracing contacts of contacts (red) is beneficial when sufficient contact tracing/ring vaccination capacity exists (dotted lines). In these scenarios, all parameters are the same as in Figure 3A; the number of contact tracings possible per day is either 20 or 40 per day. Contacts of contacts are traced in two scenarios; in the other two, only direct contacts of cases are traced. For low levels of ring vaccination (20 per day), tracing contacts of contacts is harmful; for high levels (40 per day) of ring vaccination, it is beneficial to trace contacts of contacts. When the contact tracing/ring vaccination capacity is too small to adequately cover contacts of the cases themselves, diversion of resources to contacts of contacts is harmful; however, provided that sufficient capacity exists, tracing contacts of contacts helps outrun the chain of transmission. Each line corresponds to the average of 100 realizations.

          Because we assumed nonzero diagnosis probabilities during the prodromal period for all individuals in Figure 3A, we repeated the simulation assuming no diagnosis in the prodromal period unless individuals were under specific surveillance. The results were nearly identical: assuming 30 contact tracings (ring vaccinations) per day, we found 26% of the scenarios in Figure 3A exhibited decontainment, and 28% assuming no diagnosis during the prodromal period; assuming 40 contact tracings per day, we found 1 out of 100 scenarios showed loss of containment in Figure 3A and when we repeated the scenario of Figure 3A assuming no diagnosis during the prodromal period.
          In Figure 3B, we illustrate control of an epidemic for which all parameters are identical to Figure 3A, except that the workplace/social group size is 12 (instead of 8, as in Figure 3A), and the probability of finding workplace/social contacts is 60% (instead of 80%, as in Figure 3A). In this case, the larger size of the workplace/social groups and the lower contact finding probability makes it necessary to have a higher ring vaccination capacity to attain a high probability of containing the epidemic, and on average it takes longer for eradication to finally occur.
          Finally, in Figure 3C, we show control of an epidemic in a population of 100,000, beginning with 1000 initial infectives, keeping all other parameters the same as in Figure 3A. Each curve corresponds to the indicated number of possible ring vaccinations per day. This figure shows that assuming sufficient capacity, ring vaccination is in principle capable of containing even epidemics beginning with very many infected individuals. However, mass vaccination in such cases is justified because of the far larger number of individuals at risk and the inability to perform such extensive contact tracing.
          In Figure 3D, we compare the effect of tracing contacts of contacts (as described in Appendix 2 [see additional file 2]) at different levels of ring vaccination capacity. Thin lines in red correspond to the presence of tracing contacts of contacts; thick lines in black correspond to tracing direct contacts of cases only. Each simulation was performed 100 times, with 10 initial infectives, and for 20 and 40 ring vaccinations possible per day (as indicated). The average number infected on each day is plotted in the Figure. The figure illustrates that when ring vaccination capacity is low, tracing contacts of contacts (as modeled) yields a more severe average epidemic; when ring vaccination capacity is large, tracing contacts of contacts results in a less severe average epidemic; if the contact tracing/ring vaccination capacity is too low to cover adequately the contacts of contacts in addition to the contacts of cases, extension of tracing to the contacts of contacts (the second ring) is harmful; however, if there is sufficient capacity to cover the contacts of contacts, then the tracing of contacts of contacts is beneficial.
          Finally, in Figure 4, we illustrate the considerable variability that may be seen from simulation to simulation. This figure shows twenty simulations when contacts of contacts are not traced. Stochastic variability between realizations is considerable, even when all parameters are held constant; this variability is expected to limit the ability to make inferences based on observation of a single realization of the process.
          
            Figure 4
            
              Stochastic variability is illustrated by plotting the number of infectives over time over multiple replications. In this example, most simulations exhibit rapid containment of smallpox. The mean number of cases (averaging over simulations) is influenced by a small number of simulations exhibiting an uncontained epidemic. The parameters are the same as in Figure 3A, except that contacts of contacts are not traced in these replications.
            
            
          
          Because our baseline hazard for infection of individuals may be larger than would be expected for naturally occurring smallpox, we examined the effect of more realistic values of this hazard. In particular, we chose different levels of ring vaccination capacity (10, and 20), and of the relative hazard for workplace/social contacts, and then chose values of the baseline hazard for infection varying from 0.5 per day (for a mean time to infection of 2 days) to 2 per day (for a mean time to infection of one half day), and introduced 10 index cases into a population of 10000. We then repeated this 100 times, and reported the fraction of scenarios in which the number of infections ultimately exceeded 500 (as before, chosen as a cutoff to indicate the ultimate ""escape"" of containment of the epidemic). These results, shown in Table 3, support the idea that ring vaccination can easily control introduced smallpox provided there is sufficient capacity and efficacy of tracing.
          
            Table 3
            
              Estimated decontainment probability  for different levels of ring vaccination capacity (Kr) and relative hazard for infection due to workplace/social contacts (h2), for different levels of the baseline hazard for infection from household contacts λ (based on replications of 100 simulations for each level). For each scenario, 10 index cases were introduced into a population of size 10000. All other parameters were the same as for Figure 3A. As before, we define decontainment to mean that the total number of cases from 10 index cases eventually exceeded 500 by day 250.

          Because of considerable uncertainty in the model parameters, we chose a collection of parameter values, and for each, estimated the containment probability (operationally defined as fewer than 500 total cases as a result of 10 index cases, within 250 days). We estimated this containment probability by simulating the smallpox epidemic 100 times for the same parameter values, and computing the frequency out of these 100 realizations for which fewer than 500 index cases resulted within 250 days. (Using a 1000 day window produces slightly smaller containment estimates; for 3 out of 1000 parameter set choices, this difference was greater than 0.06; the maximum difference seen was 0.23; the mean absolute difference was 0.0029; in only one case out of 1000 did we see containment in all 100 cases for the 250-day window, but not in all 100 cases for the 1000-day window).
          One thousand scenarios chosen from a Latin Hypercube sample were analyzed, and as indicated before, we chose the hazard for close contact transmission and the hazard for random transmission to guarantee that between 2 and 5 secondary cases per case occur, and that no more than 5% of cases are attributable to random transmission (we refer to this set as the ""calibrated"" scenarios further in this text). Having chosen this collection of 1000 parameter sets, we considered two levels of two different control parameters which were applied to each (so that each of the 1000 parameter sets were simulated under four different control conditions). The first of the two control parameters was the probability of workplace/social group contact finding; we chose values of 0.8 and 0.9 for this parameter (the household contact finding probability was 0.95 in all cases). The second of the control parameters was the rate of diagnosis (and effective removal) from the community of cases developing among previously identified and traced contacts who were initially asymptomatic (we refer to this as the monitored diagnosis rate); we assumed first a low level corresponding to a mean diagnosis time of one day from the onset of symptoms, and a high level corresponding to a mean time of 3 hours from the onset of symptoms (high levels of the monitored diagnosis rate correspond effectively to isolation of contacts). Finally, we assumed a doubling of the diagnosis rate after the beginning of widespread community awareness of smallpox. We then computed the containment fraction at different levels of ring vaccination capacity (contact tracing capacity per day). Thus, for each of 1000 scenarios (parameter set choices), we assigned the workplace/social group contact tracing success probability (υ2), the monitored diagnosis rate φ (Appendix 2 [see additional file 2]), and the contact tracing/ring vaccination capacity per day (Kr). We then performed 100 realizations beginning with 10 index cases, and computed the containment fraction (fraction showing fewer than 500 cases in 250 days, beginning with 10 index cases). Thus, for each of the two choices each of υ2 and φ, and for each value of Kr we examined, we obtained 1000 values of the containment fraction. We use the resulting distributions in Figure 5A (averaging over these 1000 containment fractions), and Figure 5B (displaying the minimum value of the 1000 containment fractions).
          In Figure 5A, we plot the mean containment fraction (averaging the containment fraction over all 1000 scenarios), as ring vaccination capacity varies, for the two levels of workplace/social group contact finding probabilities (0.8 and 0.9), and for the two levels of monitored diagnosis rate among initially asymptomatic contacts (1 day-1 and 8 day-1). For low levels of ring vaccination (traceable contacts per day), the epidemic is almost never contained, but for ring vaccination levels near 50–60 per day (5–6 per index case per day), the average containment fraction became close to 1. However, this average conceals the fact that for some scenarios (parameter sets chosen from the calibrated uncertainty analysis), control remains difficult or impossible even at high levels of ring vaccination. Therefore, in Figure 5B, we plotted the single lowest containment fraction seen out of the 1000 computed; focusing on the single worst scenarios reveals a different picture, and shows that isolation of asymptomatic contacts and very high probabilities of finding workplace or social contacts would be needed to control smallpox under these most pessimistic parameter choices.
        
        
          Effect of contact tracing speed
          Rapid contact tracing in ring vaccination may play an important role in suppressing the epidemic, since the longer it takes to trace a contact, the less likely the vaccine is to be efficacious, and the more opportunities the infected individual may have to transmit disease before they are finally located, isolated, and vaccinated if appropriate. We illustrate this possibility in Figure 6 by examining the same scenario we showed earlier in Figure 3A (e.g. households of size 4, workplace/social groups of size 8, 95% of household contacts traceable, 80% of workplace/social groups traceable, an average time to infection for a household contact of an infective given by 0.2 days). We assume in one case that contacts may be traced quickly (1 day for a household contact, 2 days for a workplace/social contact), and in the other that the contacts are on average found slowly (5 days for a household contact, 10 days for workplace/social contacts); we assumed 30 ring vaccinations (traceable contacts) possible per day. In this scenario, the epidemic is more severe and containment (as we have been defining it) less likely when contact tracing is slow: in the fast scenario, 238 infections occurred on average and the (estimated) containment probability was 99%; for the slow scenario, on average 3587 infections occurred and the (estimated) containment probability was only 1%.
          
            Figure 6
            
              Faster contact tracing may improve the efficacy of ring vaccination. We assume the same baseline parameters as in Figure 3A (e.g. households of size 4, workplace/social groups of size 8, 95% of household contacts traceable, 80% of workplace/social contacts traceable), and 30 ring vaccinations available per day (with contacts of contacts not traced). The fast scenario corresponds to an average one day delay for household and two days for workplace/social contacts (as in Figure 3A); the slow scenario corresponds to an average five day delay for household and ten day delay for workplace/social contacts. This figure shows the average of one hundred realizations starting with ten index cases.
            
            
          
          While Figure 6 illustrates the possibility that rapid contact tracing may be of decisive importance in some scenarios (parameter set choices), this is not always the case. For some parameter sets, the probability of tracing contacts (household or workplace/social) may be too low, or the transmission rate too high, for more rapid contact tracing to make any difference. Conversely, for other parameter sets, the smallpox transmission rate may be so low that smallpox is easily contained even with slow contact tracing. While rapid contact tracing is never harmful, overall, how typical are the results of Figure 6 (in which rapid contact tracing was important in ensuring the efficacy of ring vaccination)? To address this question, we simulated the growth of smallpox for the 1000 ""calibrated"" scenarios we used in Figure 5A and 5B. As before, we assumed ten initial cases, and (as in Figure 6) that 30 ring vaccinations were possible per day; then we simulated 100 epidemics assuming one day to find a household contact (and 2 days to find a workplace/social contact). We then simulated 100 epidemics assuming that it takes five days to find a household contact and 10 days to find a workplace/social contact (as in Figure 6). For each of these 1000 scenarios, we calculated the fraction of simulations for which the total number of cases is 500 or less within 250 days, i.e. the containment fraction. For nearly all scenarios (parameter set choices), the containment fraction was smaller (sometimes much smaller) when the contact finding time is faster (since faster contact finding, all else being equal, improves smallpox control, as illustrated in Figure 6). However, for 64.5% of the scenarios (parameter set choices) examined, the difference was less than 2.5% in absolute terms (smallpox was either contained or not contained depending on other factors, and rapid contact tracing did not make the difference). On the other hand, for 18.7% of the scenarios examined, the absolute difference in the containment probability was 20% or more; thus, a substantial difference in containment probability is occasionally attributable to the difference between fast and slow contact tracing.
        
        
          Effect of more rapid diagnosis
          Public awareness of smallpox, leading to more rapid isolation and identification, may play an important role in eliminating the epidemic, as illustrated by the scenarios in Figure 7. We assumed 20 ring vaccinations possible per day, a capacity too small to contain the epidemic in the absence of increased surveillance or diagnosis; the black line in the figure shows the steeply rising average number of cases for the first 100 days. If, however, surveillance or public awareness of the symptoms of smallpox increases the diagnosis rate by 50% (multiplies the baseline diagnosis rates by 1.5), containment becomes possible (blue line); with a doubling of the diagnosis rate (red line) the peak number of cases is lower still. In these scenarios, increased diagnostic rates markedly improve the ability of ring vaccination to control the epidemic, this suggest that any ring vaccination effort be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance.
          
            Figure 7
            
              More rapid diagnosis due to public awareness or increased surveillance may lead to far more effective epidemic control. We assume the same baseline parameters as in Figure 3A, and averaged 100 realizations of the epidemic beginning with 10 index cases and assumed a ring vaccination capacity of 20 per day (and contacts of contacts not traced). For the black line, the diagnosis rate of cases does not change after the first case is identified (the multiplier is 1.0); for the blue line, the diagnosis rate increases by 50% (multiplier 1.5) after the first case is identified (as in Figure 3A), resulting in substantially fewer cases; and for the red line, the diagnosis rate is doubled (multiplier 2.0) after the first case is identified, resulting in still fewer cases.
            
            
          
          In many cases, however, more rapid diagnosis was not required for ring vaccination to be effective. As before, we simulated smallpox epidemics for each of 1000 calibrated scenarios, performing 100 realizations each beginning with 10 index cases, and computed the fraction of scenarios for which the epidemic was always contained (as defined earlier), assuming no change in diagnosis rates. We assumed 80 ring vaccinators per day, contact finding probabilities of 0.95 for households and 0.8 for workplace/social contacts (as in Figure 3A). Under these assumptions, for 83.4% of the scenarios, the epidemic was contained within 500 total cases in each of the 100 realizations, even with no change in diagnosis rates. Uncertainty analysis (using the 1000 calibrated scenarios, and based on the fraction of 100 replications showing decontainment) revealed the most important parameters which predict the failure of ring vaccination without more rapid diagnosis were the same as we found in the earlier uncertainty analysis; a higher fraction vaccinated before the epidemic, smaller households or workplace/social groups, less transmissibility, lowered infectivity prior to the rash, more rapid diagnosis, and a higher rate of diagnosis for alerted individuals all contribute to a greater containment probability even without an overall increase in the diagnosis rate.
        
        
          Effect of continued surveillance of contacts
          We have been assuming that whenever an individual is contacted during an investigation, the individual will be diagnosed more quickly should they subsequently develop symptoms. When transmission is assumed to be very rapid (smallpox is assumed to be highly contagious), most individuals may already be infected when identified through contact tracing from an infective. Using the scenario we examined in Figure 3A, we see that continued surveillance of contacts is an essential component of effective ring vaccination designed to control rapidly spreading smallpox: if smallpox in a contact is not diagnosed any more quickly than for a non-contact, containment by ring vaccination requires over 98% contact finding probabilities for both household and workplace/social contacts – even if unlimited numbers of ring vaccinators are available; containment cannot be guaranteed by adding additional ring vaccination capacity if the contact finding rates are too low and/or the follow-up for contacts is insufficient. Smallpox which is transmitted less rapidly to contacts would, however, be containable with a lower contact finding probability (results not shown).
          Finally, we used the ""calibrated"" scenarios (parameter set choices) to explore the levels of contact finding probability needed to contain the epidemic (as before, defined to mean 500 or fewer cases ultimately resulting from ten initial cases) (Table 4). In these scenarios, we assumed that all traceable contacts were followed up very quickly (1/a = 1 hour, so that cases arising in previously contacted persons almost never transmit the infection further). We chose different levels of household and workplace/social contact finding probabilities and different levels of ring vaccination capacity, and performed 100 replications of each of the 1000 different scenarios. In Table 4 we report the fraction of scenarios for which all 100 replications exhibited containment. Scenarios in which smallpox is highly contagious require high contact finding probability to ensure the containment of the epidemic.

              Containment of severe smallpox at different levels of contact finding. The first three columns are assumed levels for the probability of finding a household contact, the probability of finding a workplace/social (W/S) contact, and for the number of contact tracings/ring vaccinations possible per day; the last two columns express (as percentages) the resulting probability of containment given the assumed contact finding probabilities and contact tracing capacities; two containment probabilities are given: the containment probability when only contacts of cases are traced (first column, ""Contacts""), and the containment probability when contacts of contacts of cases are traced in addition to the contacts of cases (second column, ""Contacts of Contacts""). All other parameters are the same as in Figure 3A.

          Transmission prior to rash
          Transmission prior to the rash makes epidemic control more difficult. In Figure 8, we show an expanding smallpox epidemic assuming differing levels of infectivity prior to the rash (adding increased infectivity prior to the rash, keeping constant the infectivity after the rash). We assume all parameters are the same as in Figure 3A (and that the ring vaccination capacity is 40 per day). Infectivity prior to the rash is modeled as the relative infectivity during the short (1 day) period of oropharyngeal lesions just prior to the rash (compared to the infectivity during the first week of the rash), and as the relative infectivity during the prodromal period (relative to the period just prior to the rash). We consider three scenarios: a relative infectivity during entire period is one (i.e., infectivity during the prodromal period and just prior to the rash is the same as during the first week of the rash), b the relative infectivity just prior to the rash is the same as during the first week of the rash, but during the prodromal period is 4% (as in Figure 3A) of this value, and c the relative infectivity just prior to the rash is 20% of the infectivity during the first week of the rash, and during the prodromal period is 20% of this value. The figure shows that increased infectivity just prior to the rash leads to a larger epidemic (comparing b and c); in case b (high infectivity just prior to onset of rash), loss of containment occurs 36% of the time (but in none of the 100 realizations shown in case c (low infectivity prior to rash)). Scenario a (full infectivity during entire the prodromal period) showed loss of control in every realization. Increasing the ring vaccination capacity from 40 per day to 80 per day (results not shown) led to containment in all of the realizations with high infectivity just prior to the rash and low infectivity during the prodromal period (case b), but made no difference if the infectivity was as high during the prodromal period as during the rash (case a). While intuitively adding additional infectiousness must increase the number of secondary cases and make control more difficult, these results do illustrate that even a small amount of increased infectiousness prior to the rash (when diagnosis is more difficult) may substantially increase the difficulty of smallpox control.

              Transmission prior to the rash makes epidemic control more difficult. The figure shows a expanding smallpox epidemic assuming differing levels of infectivity prior to the rash. We assume all parameters are the same as in Figure 3A (and that the ring vaccination capacity is 40 per day). Infectivity prior to the rash is modeled as the relative infectivity during the short (1 day) period of oropharyngeal lesions just prior to the rash (compared to the infectivity during the first week of the rash), and as the relative infectivity during the prodromal period (relative to the period just prior to the rash). For scenario a, relative infectivity during the prodromal period and just prior to the rash is the same as during the first week of the rash, for scenario b, the relative infectivity just prior to the rash is the same as during the first week of the rash, but during the prodromal period is 4% (as in Figure 3A) of this value, and for scenario c, the relative infectivity just prior to the rash is 20% of the infectivity during the first week of the rash, and during the prodromal period is 20% of this value (these two parameters are the same as in Figure 3A).
            
            
          
        
        
          Other factors
          Finally, in Figure 9, we present scenarios in which each of four other parameters are modified from the baseline values of Figure 3A, assuming 40 contact tracings (ring vaccinations) are possible per day (line a in the figure). Specifically, we assume that severe smallpox (hemorrhagic and flat) on average takes four times longer to diagnose and isolate than ordinary smallpox (case b), that no one in the population has prior vaccination protection (from before the discontinuation of routine vaccination, case c), that 10% more smallpox is too mild to diagnose (but still contagious, case d) compared to baseline, and finally that the vaccine is completely ineffective (case e). Each of these scenarios will be discussed further below.
          
            Figure 9
            
              Additional scenarios, assuming 40 ring vaccinations or contact tracings possible per day, and that contacts of contacts are traced; all parameters are identical to those in Figure 3A unless otherwise indicated. The figure shows the average of 100 replications of five scenarios (Case a repeats the result from Figure 3A for reference); the numbers in parentheses in the legend are the corresponding fraction of the 100 scenarios for which decontainment occurred. For case b, we assumed that flat and hemorrhagic smallpox cases took four times as long on average to diagnose as ordinary cases; for case c., we assumed that no one in the population had prior protection (as opposed to 25% for Figure 3A); for case d, we assumed that an additional 10% of individuals (13% instead of 3%) would develop mild smallpox (with 75% developing ordinary smallpox instead of 85% as in Figure 3A); and for case e, we assumed that the vaccine is completely ineffective and provides no protection against infection.
            
            
          
          Scenario b was motivated by the possibility that individuals with severe forms of smallpox may be more difficult to diagnose, and thus remain infectious in the community longer (despite the much greater degree of illness of such patients), or that such patients may be more infectious. In this particular case, quadrupling the mean diagnosis time led to one additional replication out of 100 in which containment was not achieved (2/100, compared to the baseline of 1/100). However, we assumed that community awareness of smallpox leads to the same relative rate of increased diagnosis among severe cases as for ordinary cases, and that the most severe forms are relatively rare. In addition to the scenario shown in the figure, we also replicated the same 1000 ""calibrated"" simulations, assuming that in each case 40 contact tracings per day are possible and that the diagnosis time for severe cases was four times that of ordinary cases. Finally, we repeated each ""calibrated"" scenario 100 times assuming long diagnosis times for severe cases, and not making this assumption, and found that the difference in the decontainment fraction was not large (results not shown).
          Scenario c illustrates that vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination does play a role in smallpox control by ring vaccination; there were more decontainment scenarios (5/100) when no prior protection exists in the population. The results suggest that prior vaccination aids in the control of smallpox, but that it is not strictly necessary for control (in this scenario, 95% of the replications exhibited containment). In Figure 3A, we assumed 25% of individuals had protection due to vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination; in scenario c of Figure 9, we assumed this fraction was zero.
          Scenario d demonstrates that if 10% more smallpox infections (in absolute terms, i.e. 13% compared to 3% in Figure 3A) lead to mild cases among individuals with no prior protection, the epidemic is more difficult to contain (13/100 replications showed loss of containment).
          Finally, scenario e demonstrates that containment is still possible even when the vaccine is completely ineffective in everyone – because of case isolation and isolation of contacts (and of contacts of contacts). Here, with 40 contact tracings possible per day, 55% of the replications nevertheless exhibited containment even with a vaccine which offered no protection whatever. With 90 contact tracings possible per day, all replications exhibited containment even assuming no vaccine protection.
        
        
          Effect of mass vaccination
          Although less efficient than ring vaccination in the sense that more vaccinations must be delivered to eliminate infection, comprehensive mass vaccination following the introduction of smallpox is sufficient to eliminate the infection. In Figure 10, we show the probability of achieving containment (defined to be fewer than 500 total cases resulting from 10 index cases) for different levels of ring vaccination (0, 5, 10, and 20 vaccinations per day) and mass vaccination (0, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%; compare with the 10%-20% per day many jurisdictions in the United States are planning to vaccinate). Specifically, for each level of ring vaccination and mass vaccination, we used the same 1000 parameter sets used in Figure 5, and performed 100 simulated epidemics for each parameter set. On the vertical axis, we plot the fraction of the 1000 scenarios for which each of the 100 simulated epidemics was contained. We further computed the fraction of scenarios for which none of the 100 simulated epidemics was contained; this is indicated by the colored segment in the small pie chart at each symbol. When the mass vaccination rate was 2% per day, the mean number of deaths (averaging over all scenarios and all simulations within each scenario) was 47.7, 33.7, 26.4, and 20.1 for a ring vaccination level of 0, 5, 10, and 20 per day (respectively) out of a population of 10000. Moreover, when we increased the mass vaccination level to 3%, an average of 28.9 deaths occurred when no ring vaccination was used, but this fell to 22.3 deaths when only 5 ring vaccinations per day were available (again assuming a population of 10000, and 10 index cases). With a mass vaccination level of 5% per day, an average of 18.8 deaths occurred without ring vaccination, and 15.8 deaths occurred when only 5 ring vaccinations per day were possible. (At a mass vaccination rate of 3% per day, containment as defined above was achieved in all 100 replications for 95% of the scenarios even without ring vaccination; at a mass vaccination rate of 5% per day, containment was achieved in all replications for all scenarios.) These results show that over a wide range of simulated epidemics, even seemingly small levels of ring vaccination (coupled with follow-up) may have a substantial effect in preventing epidemic spread and reducing deaths from smallpox, even during a mass vaccination campaign. Note that many jurisdictions in the United States are planning mass vaccination campaigns which could reach 10%-20% of the population per day, far greater than the mass vaccination levels examined here; it is interesting to note that mass vaccination campaigns may be effective in preventing a widespread epidemic even at much lower levels than are being planned for. Where feasible, such rapid mass vaccination rapidly eliminates smallpox transmission in our model; vaccination of contacts is still beneficial, since we are assuming that earlier vaccination yields a greater probability of preventing or ameliorating infection (results not shown).

The shaded pie segments represent the fraction of 1000 scenarios for which containment (as defined in the text) was never realized; the vertical position of the pie chart represents the fraction of the 1000 ""calibrated"" scenarios for which containment was always achieved. As the fraction of the population mass vaccinated increases or the ring vaccination capacity increases, the probability of containment increases.
            
            
          
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      We constructed a simple network model of smallpox transmission, and addressed the question of what circumstances contribute to the success of a ring vaccination campaign designed to control smallpox. Our analysis focused on the use of contact tracing/ring vaccination to prevent a widespread epidemic following a deliberate release.
      We conducted a sensitivity analysis based on particular, but reasonable, ranges for the unknown parameters. Our results are consistent with prior vaccination models in identifying prior vaccination and ring vaccination capacity as significant factors in determining the spread of smallpox. Unsurprisingly, we also find that household size and ring vaccination speed are particularly important parameters; these results are intuitively plausible. The contact finding probability did not appear important in this analysis only because a narrow range of values was chosen.
      We illustrated smallpox control by presenting scenarios based on control of moderately severe smallpox epidemics. We find that swift, aggressive contact tracing and ring vaccination is is usually sufficient to bring the infection under control. Provided that there is sufficient capacity, vaccination of contacts of contacts is beneficial, and results in fewer infected individuals and more rapid elimination of infection; investigating contacts of contacts allows the chain of transmission to be outrun to some extent. When ring vaccination capacity is small, diversion of crucial resources away from contacts is harmful; contacts of contacts should only be traced and vaccinated provided that no resources are diverted away from contacts of cases. The increased surveillance (or isolation) of contacts, together with improved rates of diagnosis due to community awareness, play important roles in smallpox control; we note that in some cases, lowered diagnosis rates among severe cases contributed to a small extent to loss of epidemic control, and suggest that any public awareness campaign include information to help the public be more aware of the full spectrum of the clinical features of smallpox.
      One limitation of our analysis is that we chose not to explicitly incorporate the specific epidemiology of health care workers (or mortuary workers), who are likely to be exposed to infected individuals during any smallpox epidemic (e.g. ), and who may then infect further members of the community  (as was also seen in the recent outbreak of SARS, e.g. ). Transmission to health care workers may be considered to amplify the initial attack or to be simply accounted among the exposures we considered (and thus be approximated by the behavior of our model), since health care workers and their household contacts are in all likelihood traceable contacts, and ring vaccination/contact tracing would identify and halt these chains of transmission as in our model. The disruption of smallpox control and patient care that may occur is not accounted for in our analysis, however, causing our model in this sense to err on the side of optimism. The appropriateness of pre-event vaccination of health care workers or other first responders has been addressed by other analyses , and is beyond the scope of our model.
      While we analyzed the effect of contact tracing, case and contact isolation, and ring vaccination (together with mass vaccination), in a real smallpox epidemic, in practice, control efforts are unlikely to be limited strictly to vaccinating contacts (and health care workers, as likely contacts) and isolating cases. Indeed, making vaccine available to individuals who believe they live near cases or to others on a voluntary basis occurred in smallpox control efforts in the past . Vaccination of such individuals can only harm the disease control effort if it hinders or delays the diagnosis of cases or the investigation and vaccination of contacts; our results show that even relatively low levels of vaccination of the general population may have a beneficial effect in preventing the epidemic from escaping control.
      More serious is the possibility that individuals who should be vaccinated or isolated would be missed; this could occur either because individuals or institutions did not cooperate with the disease control effort, or because the individuals simply could not be found. Our analysis suggests that ring vaccination need not be perfect to successfully contain the epidemic, and yet, under conditions where there is a high rate of infection among contacts, or a relatively high rate of casual transmission, high rates of contact finding (in excess of 90%), together with increased surveillance and contact isolation, are needed to contain the epidemic.
      Finally, the vaccination of individuals at low risk of contracting smallpox will cause harm due to adverse events of the vaccine; in our model, the assumed death rate due to vaccination was small compared to the probability of death from smallpox, and played essentially no role in the analysis. In practice, individuals suspected to be at high-risk for vaccine complications, but at relatively low risk for contracting smallpox, might simply be isolated or closely monitored even during an outbreak; while the presence of individuals in the population at higher risk for vaccine complications would increase the death rate during an outbreak, such individuals are unlikely to impair the containment of the epidemic (the primary focus of this analysis).
      Our results support ring vaccination against epidemics of smallpox (even assuming high rates of transmission to close contacts), but do note that stochastically, for severe (rapidly transmissible) smallpox, scenarios of loss of control are seen, with resulting widespread epidemics. In scenarios in which the transmission potential of smallpox is smaller, such loss-of-control scenarios occur less frequently (results not shown). Mass vaccination campaigns, when conducted quickly and with very high coverage, do not result in loss of control in our model. Nevertheless, fewer deaths due to smallpox result when ring vaccination is conducted along with mass vaccination.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Simulated smallpox epidemics with ring vaccination suggest that aggressive, fast ring vaccination can control epidemics of smallpox. To do so, however, smallpox must be identified quickly and contacts vaccinated promptly. We also identify public awareness of smallpox – leading to prompt identification of cases – as a major factor in smallpox control; in some simulations, it may play a role as significant as ring vaccination itself . However, we also found that uncertainty in (1) transmission from mild cases, (2) the household size, and (3) casual transmission contributed to the overall uncertainty in the epidemic size. Other parameters to which the number of infections were highly sensitive were the prior vaccination fraction, parameters related to infectiousness, and parameters related to transmission prior to the rash.
      Because our model combines network structure with response logistics, our results support and complement the results of other investigators. Our results support the notion that prior vaccine protection may play an important role in slowing the epidemic , despite the possibility that some vaccinated individuals may develop mild cases which are harder to identify, but which nevertheless transmit disease. Likewise, our results provide support for the view that ring vaccination should play a central part in smallpox control. If initiated, ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination, should include contacts of contacts (whenever there is sufficient capacity to cover all contacts of cases), and should be accompanied by a vigorous campaign of public awareness which can facilitate more rapid identification and isolation of cases. We assumed that ring vaccination could be fast (little delay between identification of a case and vaccination of the contacts), effective (nearly all household contacts can be found, and most of workplace and social contacts), and available (there is sufficient capacity). To be effective, ring vaccination planning must yield a system capable of meeting these benchmarks; we should not only be able to assess the number of contact vaccinations that will be possible per day, but should have a plan in place to (1) identify contacts by working with individuals, employers, schools, community representatives, and authorities or businesses who may have access to information facilitating contact tracing, (2) rapidly investigate and vaccinate such individuals, perhaps using field teams managed by central dispatch. It is important to realize that for high-risk, transient, or unstably housed populations where reliable contact tracing is impossible, the conclusions of the model we present cannot be applied. It is important to note that while our model suggests that ring vaccination together with contact tracing and isolation is likely to be successful, we found that for some scenarios (where smallpox was more transmissible, or was relatively more transmissible before the rash), epidemic containment required not only ring vaccination, but increased public awareness, the isolation of contacts, and tracing of contacts of contacts. For scenarios in which the smallpox was less transmissible, epidemic containment was possible at lower contact finding probabilities. Thus, while our simulations suggest that contact tracing/ring vaccination need not be perfect to succeed, because of uncertainties in our knowledge of the behavior of bioterrorist smallpox, it is impossible to know in advance how good it will have to be. Thus, that high contact finding rates, mass public awareness leading to early identification of cases, isolation of contacts, and investigation of contacts of contacts should all be conducted with maximum effectiveness to reduce the probability of a widespread epidemic.
      While the possibility of smallpox uncontrollable by ring vaccination has made mass vaccination preparations wise, and while mass vaccination may be unavoidable in the event of a deliberate release of smallpox, we believe that ring vaccination is essential in any case. This is not only because individuals recently exposed to smallpox may be protected if they are vaccinated promptly, but because each contact identified potentially lies in the immediate future of the transmission chain. From the standpoint of epidemic control, it is far more valuable to vaccinate individuals next in the transmission chain than to vaccinate other persons. Our results support the idea that ring vaccination/case isolation may in many, if not most cases, eliminate smallpox even without mass vaccination, but also support planning for mass vaccination (so that the vastly more costly and difficult policy of mass vaccination will be available in the event of an explosive epidemic). When faced with the unknown, multiple redundant preparations are appropriate; case investigation/isolation may control smallpox even if the vaccine does not work at all, but mass vaccination is useful in the event of an explosive epidemic for which case tracking becomes impossible.

      Background
      Oxidative stress leading to the overproduction of free radicals in the lungs is present in many clinical situations. Such clinical settings include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infants of prematurity going on to develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, drug-induced lung toxicity, cancer and aging [1-4]. Although the use of oxygen may be clinically indicated in hypoxemic situations, one must consider the potential long-term toxic side effects. For example, we know that oxygen creates cellular damage by a variety of mechanisms. Normal cellular metabolism of oxygen involves the transfer of electrons from NADH to O2 molecules to form water (H2O). At normal partial pressure, 95% of oxygen molecules (O2) are reduced to H2O and 5% are partially reduced to toxic byproducts by normal metabolism in the mitochondria . These metabolites include the superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) all of which make up what are known as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) . Exposure to conditions of hyperoxia as well as ionizing radiation (IR) leads to increased amounts of these ROS and their damaging effects.
      ROS are known to attack the lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids of cells and tissues . Lipids, including pulmonary surfactant, react with ROS to produce lipid peroxides, which cause increased membrane permeability, inactivation of surfactant, and inhibition of normal cellular enzyme processes. Proteins reacting with ROS result in decreased protein synthesis due to inhibition of ribosomal translation or destruction of formed proteins. This ultimately leads to inactivation of intracellular enzymes and transport proteins resulting in impaired cellular metabolism and accumulation of cellular waste products. Lastly, ROS cause damage to nucleic acids by leading to modified purine and pyrimidine bases, apurinic (AP) /apyrimidinic sites, and DNA protein cross-links which can lead to single strand breaks .
      Several defense mechanisms exist to combat the damaging effects of ROS. Intracellular enzymatic systems include superoxide dismutase which eliminates the superoxide anion, catalase which catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 directly to H2O without the production of the hydroxyl radical, and glutathione peroxidase which directly reduces H2O2 and lipid peroxides. Free radical scavengers, which stop free radical chain reactions by accepting electrons, include α-tocopheral (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacin (vitamin B), riboflavin (vitamin B2), vitamin A, and ceruloplasmin . These systems usually provide enough protection against oxygen metabolism under normal conditions, but may become depleted under conditions of increased oxidative stress .
      The defense mechanism of interest in this paper involves the repair of oxidative damage through the human DNA base excision repair pathway (BER). BER is the most important cellular protection mechanism that removes oxidative DNA damage . Damaged bases are excised and replaced in a multi-step process. Lesion-specific DNA glycosylase repair genes initiate this process. After removal of the damaged base, the resulting AP site is cleaved by AP-endonuclease generating a 3'OH and 5'deoxyribose phosphate (dRP). β-polymerase, which possesses dRPase activity, cleaves the dRP residue generating a nucleotide gap and then fills in this single nucleotide gap.

      The oxidative repair genes that we have analyzed in this study include 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOgg1), human Mut Y homologue (hMYH), human Mut T homologue (hMTH), and endonuclease III (hNTH) all of which are present in human cells and involved in the protection of DNA from oxidative damage. The repair enzyme hOgg1 is a purine oxidation glycosylase that recognizes and excise 8-oxoguanine lesions (GO) paired with cytosine. GO can pair with both cytosine and adenine during DNA replication . If repair of C/GO does not occur, then G:C to T:A transversions may result [5,15-17]. The repair enzyme hMYH is an 8-oxoguanine mismatch glycosylase that removes adenines misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG lesions that arise through DNA replication errors [5,18-20]. The repair enzyme hMTH hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-GTP, 8-oxo-dATP, and 2-hydroxy-dATP, effectively removing them from the nucleotide pool and preventing their incorporation into DNA (Figure 1B) . Lastly, the repair gene endonuclease III (hNTH) is a pyrimidine oxidation and hydration glycosylase that recognizes a wide range of damaged pyrimidines . hNTH has also been shown to have a similar DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity that can remove 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG/G, 8-oxoG/A, and 8-oxoG/C mispairs . Subsequent steps following hNTH are identical to those following hOgg1 (Figure 1A).
      A previous study has shown that over-expression of the DNA repair gene hOgg1 leads to reduced hyperoxia-induced DNA damage in human alveolar epithelial cells . The primary goal of our present study was to compare the protective effects of the four main lesion-specific DNA glycosylase repair genes by individually over-expressing each in lung cells and determining which of these provides the greatest degree of protection under conditions of increased oxidative stress.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Cell Culture
        The human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 (58 year old Caucasian male), was purchased from ATCC Cat No CCL-185. The cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Passaging of cells was performed every 3–4 days with cells grown to 80% confluency in a 10 cm cell culture dish (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY). Cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator.
      
      
        Retroviral Vector Construction
        The retroviral vector pSF91.1, a gift from Dr. C. Baum from the University of Hamburg in Germany, was constructed with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream to the gene expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as previously described .
        Four DNA repair genes were individually ligated into the retroviral vector pSF91.1.
        
          hOgg1-6pcDNA3.1
          was initially amplified by PCR by primers to introduce a kozak sequence at the 5' end . Digestion of this product with EcoRI and SalI was performed and then hOgg1 was subcloned into digested plasmid vector pSF91.1, with T4 DNA ligase. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm integrity of the hOgg1 gene.
        
        
          hMYH/PGEX4T-1 and hMTH/PGEX4T-1
          hMYH was a gift from Dr. A. McCullough (University of Texas Medical School, Galveston, TX) and hMTH was cloned in Dr. Kelley's lab. Plasmid DNA was prepared as above by digestion with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into pSF91.1 as above and sequencing was performed to confirm integrity of the genes.
        
        
          PGEX-6PI-hNTH1-wild type
          this gene was a gift from Dr. S. Mitra (University of Texas Medical School, Galveston, TX). Digestion with BamHI and SalI was performed and the hNTH1-wt fragment was ligated into the empty plasmid vector PUC18. The hNTH1-wt fragment was then excised with both sides flanked by EcoRI restriction sites and ligated into pSF91.1. Proper orientation of the gene was confirmed and sequencing was performed to determine the integrity of the gene.
        
      
      
        Retroviral Production and Infection
        DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) with each of the five DNA repair genes were grown in LB-broth with ampicillin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Plasmid DNA was prepared and used to transfect phoenix amphotropic cells, from the Nolan Lab (Stanford University Medical Center, San Francisco, CA), grown to ~80% confluency. On the second day sodium butyrate was added to each plate and incubated at 37°C for 6 hours. Fresh DMEM supplemented with FBS and penicillin/streptomycin was added and the plates were incubated at 33°C. Viral supernatant was collected 24 and 48 hrs later, filtered through a 0.45 μm acrodisc syringe filter (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and frozen at -80°C for later use. Retroviral titers were determined by fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Titers of viral supernatant were 8 × 105 to 1.2 × 106 particles/ml .
        2.5 × 105 A549 cells were suspended with the viral supernatant and plated in 1 well of a 6-well plate along with polybrene (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). This exposure was performed 6 hours per day for three days. At approximately five days from the beginning of the infection, the infected cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and sorted for EGFP expression.
      
      
        Western Analysis
        Cell pellets of sorted cells were resuspended in NuPage buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 20 ug of protein were loaded into individual lanes of a NuPage Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gel was then transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Osmonics Inc, Gloucester, MA). The membranes were then blocked with 1% blocking solution (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to hOgg1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), hMTH (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), hMYH (Oncogene Research Products, Darmstadt, Germany) and hNTH (Proteintech Group Inc, Chicago, IL) all at a dilution of 1:1000 except hNTH which was diluted 1:2500. They were then washed 2 times with TBST and 2 times with 0.5% blocking solution, 10 minutes per wash. The membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies at 1:1000 for 1 hour at room temperature. Lastly, the membranes were washed 4 times with TBST, 15 minutes per wash. The membranes were briefly soaked in BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and then exposed to high performance autoradiography film (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England). Kodak Digital Science 1D Image Analysis software was utilized to quantify the region of interest (ROI) band mass of individual bands on films where visualized differences were detected.
      
      
        Hyperoxic Exposure
        Sorted EGFP positive A549 cells infected with the above DNA repair genes were counted and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well, 6 wells per gene. Six hours after seeding, individual plates were placed into an oxygen chamber supplied by Dr. L. Haneline (Wells Center for Research, Indianapolis, IN) located in a 37°C incubator. The oxygen chamber was then infused with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Individual plates were removed after 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours of exposure. Control A549 cells were incubated in a normal 37°C humidified-5% CO2 incubator. O2 concentrations were monitored with a MAXO2 analyzer (Maxtec, Salt Lake City, UT). Four days from the beginning of the exposure, cells were assessed for cell growth/survival using the sulforhodamine B assay (SRB assay).
      
      
        Sulforhodamine B Assay
        The SRB assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), developed by the National Cancer Institute, provides a sensitive measure of drug-induced cytotoxicity through a colorimetric endpoint that is non-destructive, indefinitely stable, and visible to the naked eye. This assay was used to assess the cell growth/survival of over-expressed cells . Cold 10% TCA was used to fix the cells to the plate. After incubation for 1 hour at 4°C, the individual wells were rinsed with water. After air-drying, SRB solution was added to each well and cells were allowed to stain for 20–30 minutes. 1% acetic acid wash was used to rinse off unincorporated dye. Incorporated dye was then solubilized in 100 μl per well of 10 mM Tris. Absorbance was measured by a tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a wavelength of 565 nm. Background absorbance measured at 690 nm was subtracted from the measurements at 565 nm.
      
      
        Irradiation and H2O2 Exposure
        Sorted EGFP positive A549 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. Six hours after seeding, individual plates were then exposed to radiation at doses of 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 Rads or 0.2 mM, 0.4 mM, and 0.6 mM H2O2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All plates including control plates were then placed into a 37°C humidified-5% CO2 incubator. Four days after exposure, cells were fixed and assessed for cell growth/survival by the SRB assay.
      
      
        Natural Cell growth
        Sorted EGFP positive A549 cells and wild type cells were seeded individually onto four 96-well plates at 1000 cells/well. All the plates were placed into a 37°C humidified-5% CO2 incubator. Every 24 hours for 4 days, 1 plate was removed and the cells were fixed and analyzed by the SRB assay looking at cell growth under non-toxic conditions. Growth curves and exponential growth equations were determined to look at the doubling time (DT) of cells infected with each repair gene of interest compared to vector infected and uninfected wild type cells.
      
      
        Statistics
        All drug exposure experiments were performed at least three times and individual drug doses included 6–8 wells for each group of infected cells. Analysis of cell growth and exponential growth equations were determined using Microsoft Excel. All experiments involving drug exposures were normalized to the zero dose. Data are expressed as means ± SE. The significance of differences were calculated using the paired Student's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Retroviral Constructs
        The DNA repair genes hOgg1, hMYH, hMTH, and hNTH were ligated into the retroviral vector pSF91.1 (figure 2). This vector, derived from a murine stem cell virus backbone, along with each individual repair gene, was used for transfection of phoenix amphotropic cells. Viral supernatant was then collected and used to stably infect A549 cells. A heterogeneous population of A549 cells expressing EGFP was sorted so all cells used for experiments contained the genes of interest integrated into their DNA (data not shown).

        Repair Gene Expression
        Western blot analysis was performed on sorted cells in order to verify over-expression of the four genes of interest. hOgg1, hMYH, hMTH, and hNTH were all detected at their correct position on western blots (data not shown).
        Western analysis was also utilized to assess whether over-expression of each individual repair gene resulted in altered endogenous expression of the other repair genes under both non-toxic and toxic conditions (24 hrs of 95% O2 and 1000 Rad). Cells over-expressing the repair genes hOgg1, hMYH, hMTH, and hNTH did not lead to altered expression of the other endogenous repair genes under the above conditions when compared to each other or pSF91.1 vector control cells (Figure 3A,3B,3C and 3D). hOgg1's endogenous expression was below the level of detection. The pattern of endogenous expression of hNTH was consistent for each condition when comparing cells over-expressing hOgg1, hMYH, hMTH, and pSF91.1. Reduced expression of hNTH after exposure to 95% O2 was noted.

            Western analysis of A549 cells over-expressing individual repair genes and effect on endogenous glycosylase level. (A) Endogenous expression of hOgg1 was not altered in A549 cells over-expressing any of the other repair genes when analyzed after non-toxic and toxic exposures. hOgg1 protein was not detectable for any of the cells under the above conditions when compared to cells over expressing hOgg1. (B) and (C) Endogenous expression of hMTH and hMYH respectively also were not altered in A549 cells over-expressing any of the other repair genes when analyzed after non-toxic and toxic exposures. (D) Endogenous expression of hNTH was analyzed under non-toxic and toxic conditions in A549 cells over-expressing the other repair genes. Reduced expression of hNTH was observed equally with all of the other genes after exposure to 95% O2. Endogenous expression of all four genes was equivalent under the above conditions in vector control cells; pSF91.1 (data not shown).
          
          
        
        Lastly, we assessed endogenous expression of each individual repair gene in cells infected with pSF91.1 following non-toxic and toxic conditions (24 hrs of 95% O2 and 1000 Rad) at 24 and 48 hrs after the onset of exposure. Endogenous hMYH and hMTH were expressed to the same degree. hOgg1's endogenous expression was below the level of detection using western analysis (results not shown). When analyzing endogenous hNTH expression, it was noted that hyperoxia at 24 hrs and 48 hrs resulted in reduced protein expression by 93% and 64% respectively. There also was a small increase in expression of hNTH noted after 1000 Rad one day post exposure that was back to baseline by two days post exposure. ROI band mass quantification demonstrated this finding (Figure 4A and 4B). Two or more replicates were performed for each western analysis to determine consistency of the results.

        Protection from Hyperoxia and Radiation
        A549 cells expressing hMYH demonstrated increased survival after exposure to conditions with elevated levels of oxygen compared to cells expressing only the pSF91.1 vector (Figure 5A). Results were highly significant at all time points except after 12 hours O2 where it almost reached a highly significant value. The differences between pSF91.1 and hMYH varied from 12% after 12 hours O2 exposure to 7% after 72 hours O2 exposure. A549 cells expressing hMYH also demonstrated increased survival after exposure to all doses of radiation in comparison to pSF91.1 (Figure 5B). These results were also highly significant at all doses of radiation except at 250 Rads where it almost reached a highly significant value. The differences between pSF91.1 and hMYH varied from 12%–14% for all doses of radiation. Also noted in these experiments was that vector control cells demonstrated no significant difference in survival at all doses of O2 and radiation in comparison to wild type A549 cells.

Brackets indicate statistical significance at * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.001 compared to pSF91.1 at each individual dose for 1 representative experiment.
          
          
        
        Experiments looking at the effects of H2O2 on cells expressing the repair genes did not demonstrate increased survival for any of these repair genes when compared to vector control cells (Figure 5C). This data demonstrates that over-expression of hMYH has the ability to improve cellular survival under conditions of hyperoxia and radiation but may not be able to overcome the toxicity of H2O2.
      
      
        Cell Growth
        Cell growth under normal conditions was ascertained to determine if over-expression of any of the repair genes caused an alteration in the growth of cells in the absence of oxidative stress. Wild type A549 cells and cells expressing pSF91.1, hNTH, hOgg1, and hMTH appeared to grow at similar rates with doubling times within the same range. A549 cells expressing hMYH did show a slower growth rate that resulted in significant differences in cell number by day 3. The calculated doubling time for the cells over expressing hMYH is > 3 hrs longer than the cells with the other repair genes and vector alone (Figure 6). This slowing of growth may allow for more time to repair DNA damage, ultimately leading to increased cell survival following oxidative stress.

A549 cells over-expressing hMYH grow at a slower rate in comparison to all other cells under non-toxic conditions resulting in a prolongation of the doubling time. Of note, all other over-expressed cells have approximately the same doubling time as wild type A549 cells. Statistical significance noted at ** p < 0.001 compared to pSF91.1 for 1 representative experiment.
          
          
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Oxidative stress to the lung leads to cellular DNA damage as evidenced by the release of specific gene products known to regulate DNA base excision repair pathways such as p53 and p21 [29-31]. Alterations in pro-inflammatory mediators, transcription factors, and other related gene products are also observed . This injury has been shown to be associated with features of both cellular necrosis and apoptosis [33-35]. The resultant cellular inflammation and death from oxidative stress has a dramatic impact on the outcome of patients in the clinical setting .
      Most of our current clinical therapy towards oxidative stress in the lung involves both supportive measures and prevention. Research dealing with oxidative lung injury has focused mainly on enhancing antioxidant enzymatic processes and free radical scavengers [37-40]. The ability to alter cellular survival by increasing specific DNA repair mechanisms may add another approach to the treatment of oxidant-mediated lung injury.
      Many investigators have used hydrogen peroxide as a substitute for hyperoxia since it is known to be one of the metabolites produced by the metabolism of oxygen. ROS such as H2O2 and those produced by hyperoxia clearly lead to DNA damage but questions exist as to whether H2O2 leads to the same deleterious effects upon DNA as hyperoxia. Analysis of our growth curves after exposure to H2O2 in comparison to hyperoxia and IR clearly indicates that cellular protection by oxidative DNA repair genes is specific to the agent used. Because no protection was observed with over-expression of any of the repair genes following exposure to H2O2, we speculate that the damage it causes is dissimilar. It may be that its damage not only involves oxidized bases, but may also include other forms of DNA, lipid, and protein damage that are not corrected by oxidative DNA repair genes. Alternatively, the amount and type of damage evoked by H2O2 could be beyond that which can be corrected by over-expressing these repair genes.
      Another form of stress known to induce damage through the formation of ROS is IR. Radiation induced free radical damage to DNA has substantial overlap with that of oxidative damage [41-43]. The protection provided by specific oxidative DNA repair genes under conditions of IR, was notable throughout our experiments only with the repair enzyme hMYH.
      The primary agent utilized to induce the formation of ROS was an oxygen rich environment. The use of oxygen as a stressor leading to the formation of ROS, offers a distinct advantage over IR and H2O2 by mimicking the clinical situation where constant exposure to hyperoxia leads to cumulative cellular damage which further compromises repair. We determined that survival of A549 cells was also enhanced to a small degree with increased expression of the repair enzyme hMYH. This was an unexpected finding as we anticipated the repair gene hOgg1 would demonstrate the greatest protection in response to oxidative stress based on previous studies, however these experiments utilized the colony forming assay (CFA) to detect improvements in survival . Additionally, the CFA may provide different results compared to the SRB assay, which allows for growth analysis over a shorter window of time. Furthermore, their study did not look at the repair enzyme hMYH and its impact on survival. Another study has investigated the repair function of hMYH in MYH-deficient murine cells. It was demonstrated that transfection of the MYH-deficient cells with a wild-type MYH expression vector increased the efficiency of A:GO repair .
      An interesting observation noted while doing our experiments lead us to look at individual growth characteristics of cells over-expressing each of the oxidative repair enzymes. Cells over-expressing the repair enzyme hMYH clearly grow at a slower rate when compared with the other enzymes. The mechanism behind this is not understood at this point in time. The repair action of hMYH is known to remove adenines misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG lesions. This lesion occurs when a C/GO lesion is allowed to replicate before being corrected by hOgg1. Repair by hMYH is not a final corrective measure. The product of hMYH activity is the lesion C/GO, which allows hOgg1 to have another opportunity to remove 8-oxoG opposite cytosine. We know that A549 cells possess the hOgg1 gene based on a previous study demonstrating the presence of this gene after amplification by genomic PCR . We also have demonstrated endogenous activity of hOgg1 in A549 cells by using an 8-oxoguanine bioactivity assay. Therefore, our explanation of these results is that the slowed growth created by hMYH may provide a wider window of opportunity for the repair process to take place, which ultimately grants endogenous hOgg1 another opportunity to remove the 8-oxoG lesion created by oxidative stress.
      As noted in the methods section, the SRB assay provides a sensitive measure of drug-induced cytotoxicity that is used to assess cell proliferation/survival. The reduced cell proliferation of A549 cells over-expressing hMYH under non-toxic conditions may likely underestimate the magnitude of the protective effect of this particular repair enzyme. This may in fact make the results even more significant.
      Recent studies have discovered hereditary variations of the glycosylase hMYH that may predispose to familial colorectal cancer . Others have looked for hMYH variants in lung cancer patients and have not identified any clear pathogenic biallelic hMYH mutations or an over-representation of hMYH polymorphisms . The A549 cell line has not demonstrated somatic mutations in hMYH, but a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) has been noted . The impact on function by this SNP is unknown. It would appear that the function of hMYH is very important in preventing somatic mutations leading to cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. Although studies to date have not demonstrated this same relationship with lung cancer, we do know that the lungs are subjected to large quantities of ROS under certain conditions as discussed earlier. The formation of mutations from oxidative stress does have other deleterious effects on cells including cellular death by necrosis and apoptosis. Tissue viability is dependent upon mutation correction and replication of the surviving cells to replace those that have died. The ability to enhance cellular survival, after specific oxidative exposures, is evident after increased production of the hMYH repair gene in these experiments.
      We additionally wanted to determine the level of endogenous expression of the glycosylase repair genes in the pulmonary epithelial A549 cell line. Others have demonstrated how different stressors lead to alterations in the endogenous production of specific repair genes. For example, it has been shown that endogenous gene expression of hOgg1 was elevated following exposure to crocidolite asbestos which is known to cause an increase in 8-oxoG levels . It has also previously been reported that treatment of A549 cells with sodium dichromate, a pro-oxidant, leads to a reduction of hOgg1 protein expression that was not observed with H2O2 . One additional study demonstrated a dose dependent down regulation of hOgg1 protein expression in rat lung after exposure to cadmium, a known carcinogen associated with the formation of intracellular ROS . In our experiments we were able to demonstrate that both hyperoxia and IR do not appear to impact the endogenous expression of hOgg1, hMYH, and hMTH at 24 and 48 hours following exposure. It was noted that endogenous hNTH was reduced after hyperoxia at 24 and 48 hours after the onset of exposure. One would speculate that this reduction in endogenous hNTH secondary to hyperoxia is related to either decreased production or increased destruction in response to O2 exposure. Over-expression of this repair enzyme did not result in improvements in survival after O2 exposure based on our experiments. It may be that endogenous levels are adequate to correct this specific mutational burden for these experiments.
      Furthermore, no previous studies have determined how cells over-expressing specific repair genes may impact endogenous expression of the other oxidative BER genes under both normal and oxidative stress conditions. We were also able to demonstrate that endogenous expression of glycosylase repair genes were not altered under these conditions secondary to the over-expression of any of these genes. This is an important finding for interpretation of survival data; protection of cells is due to the over-expression of the specific gene and not due to enhancement of other endogenous repair enzyme levels, at least for the genes studied under these conditions.
      Some limitations may exist in using a lung carcinoma cell-line, which likely differs both in proliferative properties as well as in response to oxidative stress in comparison to primary epithelial cells. The enhanced cell growth observed with cell lines may be more reflective of undifferentiated alveolar type II cells which are likely to replace terminally differentiated alveolar type I cells after injury/death due to oxidative stress. This may not be a true reflection of growth under non-toxic conditions when very little cell division is occurring. This is an inherent problem observed when comparing cell lines with primary cells and results need to be interpreted in a way that considers this.
      It is difficult to know how this will translate to pulmonary epithelial cells in vivo at this stage. It certainly would appear that the protection observed is modest in degree in this pulmonary epithelial cell line. Further experiments assessing the function of the repair enzyme hMYH in this model will be important to perform in order to delineate the findings of slowed growth under normal conditions and improved survivability under conditions of O2 and IR. More research looking at the potential for combination therapy, including DNA repair mechanisms in conjunction with other antioxidant defense mechanisms may be another approach to enhancing cell survival, which may lead to better clinical outcomes. Alternatively, cell survival may not be the most important end point for hyperoxia studies. Given that 8-oxoG, if left unrepaired, leads to G:C to T:A transversions, there may be an increase in mutational burden by these cells that isn't reflected in cell survival. Further experiments studying the impact on mutation production is underway. Ultimately, experiments need to be done in animal models to determine the translation to in vivo pulmonary cells.
    
    
      Conclusions
      In summary, we have demonstrated that over-expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH may enhance survival of a pulmonary epithelial cell line after exposure to conditions of IR and hyperoxia. We have also demonstrated that over-expression of hMYH leads to a slowing of growth of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions, which may in part play a role in this enhancement of survival by providing a wider window of opportunity for repair of oxidized lesions to occur. Lastly, we demonstrated that over-expression does not lead to altered endogenous expression of these repair genes. As the understanding of DNA repair mechanisms continues to grow and the evolution of gene therapy takes place, more treatment options may be available in the clinical setting to help with many disease processes including the damaging effects of oxygen and its metabolites.

      Background
      The purpose of this study has been to identify domains with homology to AlkB in viral genomes, in order to get a better understanding of distribution and possible function of such domains. The AlkB protein of E. coli, and probably most of its homologues, is involved in repair of alkylation damage in DNA and RNA. It repairs 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form. Recently the protein was identified as a member of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily [1-3]. The catalytic reaction requires molecular oxygen, Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate, which is subsequently converted into succinate, CO2 and formaldehyde .
      The 2OG-FeII oxygenase superfamily is widespread in Eukaryotes and bacteria , and is currently the largest known family of oxidising enzymes without a heme group . The 3D structure of several of these oxygenases is known, and they share a common fold with a structurally conserved jelly roll β-sheet core with flanking α-helices. Very few residues are totally conserved across these structures, basically just the residues involved in coordination of the Fe(II) ion and the 2-oxoglutarate.
      AlkB-like genes are widespread in most types of organisms except Archaea. However, whereas bacteria normally have just one or at most two AlkB homologues , multicellular Eukaryotes tend to have several homologues. In the human genome at least 8 different AlkB homologues (ABHs) have been identified . These homologues seem to have slightly different properties with respect to substrate preference and subcellular localisation, and this may be a reason for the proliferation of ABHs e.g. in humans. However, a detailed functional mapping of all ABHs has not yet been carried out.
      A sequence alignment of known ABHs identifies very few residues as totally conserved, basically just a HxD motif, a H and a RxxxxxR motif. These residues are also conserved in the more general 2OG-FeII oxygenase superfamily as described above, except for the final R. The first three residues (HxD and H) are involved in Fe(II)-coordination, whereas the first R is involved in 2OG-coordination. The final R is most likely involved in AlkB-specific substrate binding.
      In addition to DNA repair, it has been shown that E. coli AlkB and the human AlkB homologue hABH3 may be involved in RNA repair. When expressed in E. coli both AlkB and hABH3 reactivate methylated RNA bacteriophage MS2 in vivo. This illustrates that direct repair may be an important mechanism for maintenance of RNA in living cells . RNA repair proceeds by the same mechanism as DNA repair. Repair of damaged RNA was previously considered very unlikely, due to the natural redundancy of RNAs in a cell . However, RNA is essential for cell function: unrepaired RNA can lead to miscoded or truncated proteins, and alkylated RNA could signal cell cycle checkpointing or apoptosis . Consequently the occurrence of RNA repair does not come as a great surprise. The mechanism of direct reversal of methylation as used by AlkB homologues is particularly important for RNA repair, as it means that single-stranded regions may be repaired without introducing strand breaks. Repair of alkylation damage in DNA and RNA has recently been reviewed .
      AlkB homologues have also been found in plant viruses. It has been suggested that methylation may be used in host-mediated inactivation of viral RNAs, and that AlkB homologues in some plant viruses may be used to counteract such defence mechanisms . However, no detailed study of this has been published.
      The research project reported here has focused on a better understanding of the distribution and potential function of putative AlkB homology domains by using in silico mapping of viruses in which such domains have been found, as well as related viruses.
    
    
      Results
      The general mapping strategy of the project was to identify viral genomes with AlkB homology domains, identify common features of these genomes, and subsequently find additional genomes with similar features, but without AlkB homology domains. This data set could then be used to analyse the properties and distribution of AlkB-like domains in viruses, as a basis for generating hypotheses about the evolution and function of these domains.
      
        Identification of relevant viral protein sequences
        The PSI-Blast search for viruses in the NCBI nr protein sequence database was initiated with ALKB_ECOLI (NCBI gi113638), restricted to residues 110 to 210 and using the default inclusion threshold of 0.005 on E-values. The chosen residue range corresponds to the most conserved region in AlkB homologues .
        The PSI-Blast search converged after 4 iterations, and included 43 hits below the 0.005 inclusion threshold, from 22 different ssRNA positive-strand viruses. The AlkB homologues were found in viruses belonging to Allexi, Ampelo, Carla, Fovea, Mandari, Potex, Tricho and Vitiviruses, all of which are known to infect plants .
        In all of these viruses the AlkB domain is a part of the replicase polyprotein, which normally consists of a viral methyltransferase domain (MT), a viral helicase domain (HEL) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp). Therefore separate PSI-Blast searches for the individual components of the replicase polyprotein were also initiated. All searches were done with PSI-Blast using the default inclusion threshold (E-value of 0.005). The searches for MT and HEL domains were initiated using residue ranges 449–841 and 1938–2178 respectively from Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (Ampelovirus, NCBI gi29650261). The search for RdRp was initiated with residue range 1361–1798 from Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (Furovirus, NCBI gi11546056). These sequences were chosen based on the output from the previous AlkB search. This gave a library of protein sequences with either AlkB, MT, HEL or RdRp domains, the general composition of which is illustrated in Figure 1. From this library a subset was generated, consisting of all sequences containing MT, HEL and RdRp domains. This included processed (cleaved) polyprotein sequences where RdRp was found as a separate subsequence. However, whenever possible, the protein sequence corresponding to the genomic sequence was used. The final library, described in Table 1 and in Additional file 1, consisted of 146 sequences from a large number of different viruses.

            PSI-Blast search results shown as a Venn diagram. Initial searches using methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp domains retrieved 163, 175 and 237 sequences, respectively. A total of 146 sequences contained all three domains, and 22 of these also contained an AlkB domain.

            a Number of sequences.
            b Number of sequences with each domain type, excluding the common MT, HEL and RdRp domains (AB – AlkB, OT – OTU, PC – Peptidase C, A1 – A1pp, ot – other).
          
        
        The library of protein sequences was screened for known domains in Pfam. This identified Pfam domains Viral_helicase1 and RNA_dep_RNApol2 in all sequences, corresponding to HEL and RdRp domains, respectively. In addition Vmethyltransf and 2OG-FeII_Oxy, corresponding to MT and 2OG-FeII oxygenase (AlkB) domains, were identified in several sequences. However, for sequences from Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae there was no clear identification of any MT domain by Pfam, although they had been retrieved by PSI-Blast in a search for MT domains. Therefore HMMER was used to build a Pfam type profile for these sequences. A PSI-Blast search was initiated using residues 1–500 of Potato virus M (Carlavirus, NCBI gi9626090). Twelve representative sequences were selected from the search output, covering Carla, Fovea, Potex, Allexi, Capillo and Maculavirus. Subsequences representing the conserved region according to the PSI-Blast alignment, corresponding to residues 35–378 of the query sequence, were aligned using ClustalX, and a Pfam type profile was generated and calibrated using tools from the HMMER package. The resulting profile was able to identify putative methyltransferase domains in all Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae sequences in the data set.
        Other Pfam domains – Peptidase_C21, C23, C33, C34, C35 and C41, A1pp and OTU – were also identified in subsets of sequences. A1pp is a member of the Appr-1-p processing enzyme family, and the domain is found in a number of otherwise unrelated proteins, including non-structural proteins of several types of ssRNA viruses. OTU is a member of a family of cysteine proteases that are homologous to the ovarian tumour (otu) gene in Drosophila. Members of this family are found in Eukaryotes, viruses and pathogenic bacteria.
      
      
        Phylogenetic analysis
        The MT, HEL and RdRp domains identified by Pfam as described above were extracted from the library sequences, aligned by ClustalX, and combined into a new alignment consisting of only these domain regions. This turned out to be necessary in order to get robust alignments. The intervening regions between the conserved domains are extremely variable in these sequences, and this tended to confuse alignment programs in the sense that conserved regions were not correctly aligned. The combined sequence alignment of domains from Closteroviridae, Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae was then used as input for building a phylogenetic tree with MEGA2. The final tree is shown in Figure 2, with polyproteins containing AlkB-like domains indicated.
        
          Figure 2
          
            Unrooted phylogenetic tree for Flexiviridae 1 and 2, Tymoviridae and Closteroviridae. Sequences are labelled with genus and NCBI gi accession number. Bootstrap values ≥ 80 are shown. Sequences with AlkB domains are indicated with black dots.
          
          
        
        A second alignment was generated from all sequences with AlkB-like domains, using only the regions corresponding to MT, AlkB, HEL and RdRp Pfam domains. The domains were aligned individually, and the combined alignment was used as input for MEGA2. However, this data set did not give a reliable phylogeny (data not shown), and the separate domains of this alignment were therefore analysed individually and compared. This analysis is summarised in Table 2. For each domain a bootstrapped neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was generated with MEGA2. The average bootstrap support value over all branches was computed for each tree, and this value was clearly lower for the AlkB tree compared to the other trees. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was generated for each domain with Tree-Puzzle. This showed the same trend, the likelihood values indicated that the AlkB tree was clearly inferior to the other trees. The individual trees were then compared using the quartet-based strict joint assertions (SJA) measure as implemented in the Component software package. Both the NJ and ML trees showed the same trend. The MT, HEL and RdRp domains gave similar tree structures, with SJA values between 0.053 and 0.161 for NJ trees and between 0.058 and 0.092 for ML trees when they were compared to each other. The AlkB domain gave a significantly different tree structure, with SJA values from 0.456 to 0.524 for NJ trees and from 0.258 to 0.317 for ML trees when compared to the MT, HEL and RdRp trees (the actual trees are given in Additional file 2). For comparison the SJA values for comparing the corresponding NJ and ML trees for MT, AlkB, HEL and RdRp were 0.054, 0.000, 0.040 and 0.003, respectively, showing that the NJ and ML procedures gave almost identical tree structures. Day has estimated expectation values and standard deviations for various distance measures (including SJA) for comparison of random trees . The SJA values shown in Table 2 for comparisons between MT, HEL and RdRp NJ trees were 14.2 – 17.1 standard deviations from the expectation value of 0.665 for a tree with 22 nodes, whereas the corresponding values for the AlkB NJ tree were 4.4 – 5.4 standard deviations from the expectation value. Similar ranges were observed for the ML trees as well as for alternative distance measures, e.g. the Symmetric Difference (SD) measure (data not shown). Although this means that the SJA value for comparing AlkB trees to MT, HEL and RdRp trees were significantly better than for random trees, it also shows that the MT, HEL and RdRp trees were clearly more similar to each other than to the AlkB tree.

        The alignment of the AlkB domain seemed to be of comparable quality to the other alignments. In fact the AlkB domain had the highest average pairwise sequence identity, as seen in Table 2 (see Figure 3 for the actual alignment). In other words, these AlkB domains were as similar to each other as the other three domains with respect to sequence identity, but they did not represent a consistent evolutionary history when compared to the other domains of this polyprotein. This may indicate that the AlkB domains have evolved separately from the other domains, and possibly as several independent instances.
        
          Figure 3
          
            Multiple alignment of sequence regions corresponding to the AlkB domains. The alignment was generated with ClustalX. The residues involved in coordination of the essential Fe2+ ion are completely conserved, except in one of the Vitivirus sequences. These residues are the HxD motif, a single H, and the first R in the RxxxxxR motif. The function of the remaining conserved residues is unclear, but at least some of them may be involved in coordination of the substrate .
          
          
        
        The degree of co-evolution was analysed by computing pairwise distances between sequence regions in the alignment of MT, AlkB, HEL and RdRp domains described above. In Figure 4 selected results are shown as scatter plots, where the Blosum 50 score value between e.g. the MT domains in a pair of sequences is plotted against the score value for AlkB domains in the same pair of sequences. Plots for the MT, HEL and RdRp domains show that they are strongly correlated for MT vs. RdRp (r2 = 0.95), MT vs. HEL (r2 = 0.87) and HEL vs. RdRp (r2 = 0.81). The plot of the AlkB domain vs. these three domains for the same set of sequences shows a very low degree of correlation for AlkB vs. RdRp (r2 = 0.10), AlkB vs. MT (r2 = 0.12) and AlkB vs. HEL (r2 = 0.16).
        
          Figure 4
          
            Pairwise distances between sequence regions corresponding to methyltransferase (MT), RdRp and AlkB domains. Each data point corresponds to e.g. RP-RP and MT-MT distances for the same pair of sequences, and sequences showing similar evolutionary distance in these two regions will fall on the diagonal. The pairwise distances were estimated from multiple alignments using the Blosum50 score matrix . Trend lines were estimated with Excel. The trend line for AlkB vs. RdRp is heavily influenced by the point at (675, 670). It represents two Foveavirus sequences (NCBI gi3702789 and gi9630738), they are 98% identical over the full polyprotein sequence.
          
          
        
        As mentioned above the genome organisation of these replicase polyprotein sequences seems to be very flexible. In order to analyse domain organisation the location of identified Pfam domains were plotted for a number of sequences, as shown in Figure 5.
        
          Figure 5
          
            Location of Pfam domains in the variable region of Flexiviridae 2 sequences. The regions have been extracted directly from Pfam output, and sequences and regions are drawn to scale. The black bar at each end of a motif indicates that a full-length motif has been found, for partial motifs the bar at the truncated end would be missing.
          
          
        
      
      
        Similarity of viral AlkB domains to other AlkB sequences
        The results described above may indicate that the AlkB domains have been integrated into the replicase polyprotein relatively recently (see Discussion). In order to test for potential sources selected AlkB domains were compared to non-viral sequences. PSI-Blast was used to search the NCBI nr database, removing all viral hits in the final search report. Most of the remaining top-scoring hits were from bacteria. This included two different strains of Xanthomonas, X. axonopodis pv citri and X. campestris pv campestris. Xanthomonas attacks plants such as citrus, beans, grapevine, rice and cotton . The search also returned high-scoring hits from another plant pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa. This bacterium infects a great variety of plants, including grapevine, citrus, periwinkle, almond, oleander and coffee .
      
      
        Potential similarities in variable regions
        Pfam searches obviously will only identify known domain types in protein sequences. In order to identify potential similarities in regions that were not recognised by Pfam, systematic PSI-Blast searches were performed, using the polyprotein regions between the MT and HEL domains and searching against the NCBI database of reference sequences , excluding all viral entries. A maximum of 5 PSI-Blast iterations were allowed, with an inclusion threshold of 0.005. The expected homologues of the AlkB-domain were found with high confidence, as most of the E-values were < 1 × 10-50. Homologues of typical viral domains like the viral peptidases were obviously not found, as all viral database entries were excluded. Very few new similarities were found by these searches. Pepper ringspot virus (Tobravirus, NCBI gi20178599) showed significant similarity to site-specific DNA-methyltransferase from Nostoc sp (E = 1 × 10-74), as well as other cytosine 5C-specific DNA methylases. Bamboo mosaic virus (Potexvirus, NCBI gi9627984) showed similarity to aggregation substance Asa1 from Enterococcus faecalis (E = 6 × 10-34). A small number of additional similarities seemed to be caused by biased sequence properties (e.g. proline-rich regions), and were probably not significant. This included matches against mucin and cadherin-like proteins from Homo sapiens and multidomain presynaptic cytomatrix protein (piccolo) from Rattus norvegicus. In general the variable regions seemed to be truly variable, with very little similarity to other proteins, except for the Pfam domains already identified.
      
      
        Loss of domains in related polyprotein sequences
        As seen in Figures 2 and 5, some closely related sequences are lacking specific domains in the sense that HMMER does not find a significant similarity to the Pfam entries for these domains. In order to understand the degree of sequence variation associated with this domain loss, as well as the general sequence variation in conserved vs. non-conserved regions of typical polyproteins, several dot plots were generated. The dot plot for two Carlavirus sequences, Potato virus M (NCBI gi9626090) and Aconitum latent virus (NCBI gi14251191), is shown in Figure 6. The dot plot confirms that these two sequences are closely related in the MT, HEL and RdRp domains. However, there are significant differences in the region between MT and HEL. Potato virus M is lacking the AlkB domain whereas Aconitum latent virus is lacking the OTU domain. As seen from the dot plot, short regions of similarity close to the diagonal shows that both domains may have been present in an ancestral sequence. However, this region shows a high degree of sequence variation, and as indicated by the dot plot they are almost exclusively mutations. Non-essential or non-functional domains are probably rapidly lost. In this particular case, none of the typical AlkB motifs seem to be conserved in Potato virus M, indicating that this indeed is a non-functional AlkB domain.

      Discussion
      
        The N-terminal domains of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae are methyltransferases
        As described above the Pfam methyltransferase motif (Vmethyltransf) did not match any of the putative methyltransferase domains of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae, despite the fact that they had been identified via PSI-Blast searches starting with known methyltransferases. Therefore an additional Pfam-type profile was generated. It is obviously a possibility that these domains in Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae are not methyltransferases, and that they are false positives from PSI-Blast. However, the essential residues of a typical viral methyltransferase motif are conserved in the alignment of these domains (data not shown) . In Bamboo mosaic virus, which belongs to Flexiviridae, the residues H68, D122, R125 and Y213 have been identified as putative active site residues with similarity to the Sindbis virus-like methyltransferase , and it has been demonstrated that this region of the Bamboo mosaic virus has methyltransferase activity, as it catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to GTP or guanylylimidodiphosphate (GIDP). The corresponding sequence positions are almost completely conserved in the alignment of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae N-terminal domains. This is most likely significant, as only 7 positions in total are completely conserved in this alignment, which means that the majority of the conserved positions are known to be essential for methyltransferase activity. Work e.g. by Hataya et al. seems to support the assumption that this sequence region is a methyltransferase domain . It therefore seems likely that all the sequences with AlkB domains also contain functional MT, HEL and RdRp domains. The MT domains are probably involved in capping of genomic and subgenomic RNA .
      
      
        The viral AlkB domains are most likely functional
        Based on the bioinformatic evidence generated here, it seems reasonable to assume that the viral AlkB domains identified by Pfam are functional. All the essential residues found in 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases are conserved, in particular the putative Fe2+ coordinating H, D and H residues at alignment positions 19, 21 and 91 of Figure 3, and the 2-oxoglutarate coordinating R at position 100. The conserved R at position 106 is also very characteristic of AlkB homologues . The fact that all AlkB-like domains identified in these viral genomes are full-length, compared to the Pfam profile, also seems to support the hypothesis that these domains are functional.
      
      
        The AlkB domains are found in a subset of viral genomes
        The Pfam searches show that AlkB domains are found only in a subset of the viral genomes. This subset is phylogenetically consistent (see Figure 2), as it is mainly restricted to the Flexiviridae, and in particular to a subset of the Flexiviridae consisting of Viti, Capillo, Tricho, Fovea and Carlavirus. This subset is well separated from the remaining Flexiviridae in the phylogenetic analysis. The split seems to be robust from bootstrap analysis, therefore this family will be discussed here as two subfamilies, Flexiviridae 1 and 2. The same split was observed by Adams et al. in their recent analysis of the Flexiviridae family . Most of the AlkB domains (15) are found in Flexiviridae 2. The remaining AlkB domains are found in Flexiviridae 1 (5) and Closteroviridae (2). In general, all the Flexiviridae 2 sequences have at least one extra domain in addition to MT, HEL and RdRp: either AlkB, OTU-like cysteine protease or a peptidase. Most other plant viruses that are included in this survey do not have additional domains, except for Tymoviridae where a peptidase domain seems to be common. For the remaining plant virus families included here (excluding Tymoviridae and Flexiviridae 2), only 14% seem to have additional domains.
      
      
        Introduction of AlkB domain in plant virus is probably a recent event
        The observed distribution of AlkB domains could most easily be explained by assuming that an ancestral AlkB domain was integrated into the genome of the last common ancestor of the Flexiviridae 2 subfamily. Subsequent virus generations derived from this common ancestor would then also contain an AlkB domain, except in those cases where the domain was lost again. This scenario could also include subsequent transfer to a small number of other virus families e.g. by recombination.
        If this scenario was correct, then one would expect the different domains of the polyprotein to have a similar evolutionary history. From the phylogenetic analysis (Table 2) this seems to be confirmed for the MT, HEL and RdRp domains, but not for the AlkB domain. This indicates that the AlkB domain may not have co-evolved with the other domains, at least until relatively recently. This seems to be confirmed by looking at the degree of co-evolution, which was analysed by computing pairwise distances between alignment regions representing the relevant domains (Figure 4). In the case of perfect co-evolution all points should fall on a diagonal. This seems to be the case for the MT, HEL and RdRp domains. However, the plot of the AlkB domain vs. these three domains for the same set of sequences does not show a similar correlation. Only some of the closely related sequence pairs in the upper right quadrant of the plot in Figure 4 show some degree of correlation for AlkB vs. RdRp. The most likely explanation seems to be that most of the AlkB domains have not co-evolved with the other domains for any significant period of time. This seems to rule out the possibility of ancient integration of the AlkB domain, except if we assume that an ancient viral AlkB domain has frequently recombined with other AlkB domains. However, it is difficult to distinguish a scenario with frequent recombination of AlkB domains from de novo integration, and the net effect on the properties observed here would be the same.
        As seen in Figure 4, the range of score values is generally smaller for the AlkB domains than e.g. the RdRp domains, particularly if we exclude a couple of very high-scoring cases (see figure caption). On the other hand, the degree of sequence variation within the collection of AlkB domains is significant, average sequence identity for pairwise alignments is 38%, and only 10% of the positions are totally conserved. This can be consistent with a recent integration if we assume that several different AlkB-type vectors have been used for integration (see below for details). An increased mutation rate after integration could also have contributed to sequence diversity in this region. Moving the AlkB domain into a novel structural and functional context would have removed many of the original evolutionarily constraints, as well as introduced some new ones. This could have created a ""punctuated equilibrium"" type of situation, potentially leading to a very rapid evolution that could have introduced significant differences between the AlkB domains, independent of the evolution in the other domains. A high mutation rate seems to be the case for this region in general, as indicated in Figure 6. Although the MT, HEL and RdRp domains seem to be well conserved from the dot plot, there are very large sequence variations in the intervening region. One sequence in Figure 6 has a well conserved AlkB domain, the other an OTU domain. The fact that there are very weak sequence similarities in these two domains in the dot plot indicates that both sequences originally had both domains. However, the fact that this similarity now is very weak and without any of the typical AlkB active site motifs also indicates a high mutation rate where non-essential domains are rapidly lost. Therefore the conservation of AlkB domains is a strong indication that they are functional, as already mentioned.
      
      
        The AlkB domains may represent several separate integrations
        If we assume that AlkB domains have been integrated relatively recently, then either de novo integration or recombination (horizontal gene transfer) may have been the main driving force for spreading the AlkB domain to new genomes. In the first case a large number of individual integrations could have lead to the present situation. If horizontal gene transfer was the main driving force, the initial number of integrations might have been quite small. It is not easy to differentiate between these two situations.
        The map of Pfam motifs in the variable region between the MT and HEL domains in Flexiviridae 2 polyproteins (Figure 5) shows that they have a very similar domain organisation, basically an AlkB domain followed by an OTU domain and a peptidase domain, located towards the C-terminal part of the sub-sequence. The relatively constant domain organisation seems to be consistent with a small number of initial integrations that were subsequently diffused to related genomes e.g. by homologous recombination. However, this is not fully consistent with the fact that the viruses with AlkB domains have been collected from hosts at very different locations, e.g. Canada, USA, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, India, Taiwan, China and Japan. Although import of virus-infected species or transmission by insects may transport viruses over significant distances, it is not obvious that this is enough to explain the observed distribution of AlkB-like domains. Therefore several independent integrations, mainly from closely related hosts, have to be considered as an alternative explanation. This explanation seems to be supported by the apparent lack of any consistent evolutionary relationships between the various AlkB domains, as seen in Table 2. It is not easy to see how this model can be consistent with the observed similarities in domain organisation in Flexiviridae. Assuming that this region has a high degree of variability, one would expect the variability to affect localisation of integrated domains as well. However, it is possible that conserved regions e.g. in the polyprotein play a significant role in integration of novel domains. It may be relevant in this context that preliminary simulations indicate that e.g. the AlkB domains tend to form independent folding domains in the folded RNA structure of the polyprotein RNA (F. Drabløs, unpublished data). This property may possibly facilitate the insertion of such domains into the viral genome.
      
      
        The original AlkB integration may be of bacterial origin
        There are many groups of organisms that can act as vectors and spread viruses, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes, arthropods and arachnids. The plant viruses may have acquired the AlkB domain either from the vector or from the host itself. As already mentioned, searching with viral AlkB domains in protein sequence databases resulted mainly in bacterial sequences, including the plant pathogens X. fastidiosa and campestris. It is therefore a reasonable possibility that AlkB domains in plant viruses have originated from bacterial mRNA. It is also possible that the mRNA originated from other vectors or from the host itself, but at the present time this is not easily verified or disproved because of the limited number of insect and plant genomes that have been sequenced.
      
      
        The AlkB domain probably protects virus RNA against methylation
        It has previously been suggested that the viral AlkB domain may be involved in protecting the virus against the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system of the host . PTGS is known as one of a plant's intrinsic defence mechanisms against viruses . Gene silencing can occur either through repression of transcription (transcriptional gene silencing – TGS) or through mRNA degradation, PTGS. The PTGS-mechanism in plants shows similarities to RNA interference (RNAi) in animals . This mechanism results in the specific degradation of RNA. Degradation can be activated by introduction of transgenes, RNA viruses or DNA sequences homologous to expressed genes . Many viruses have developed mechanisms to counteract PTGS in order to successfully infect plants . Two of these suppressors of PTGS have been identified as Hc-Protease and the 2b protein of Cucumber mosaic virus . Although both proteins suppress PTGS, it is likely that they do so via different mechanisms. Could the AlkB-like domain found in some of the plant viruses also be a suppressor of PTGS? Previously reported research indicates that methylation of transcribed sequences is somehow connected with PTGS, and the methylation can be mediated by a direct RNA-DNA interaction . This RNA-directed DNA methylation has been described in plants, and leads to de novo methylation of nearly all cytosine residues within the region of sequence identity between RNA and DNA . Both RNA methylation and methylation of host proteins that are essential for viral replication would be detrimental to the virus. It has already been mentioned that AlkB repairs 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidative demethylation. It is therefore possible that AlkB demethylates the nucleotides methylated by the PTGS mechanism, helping the virus to overcome one of the major defence mechanisms of the plant.
        As shown here, only a subset of plant viruses have the AlkB domain. However, other viruses may be utilising naturally occurring AlkB proteins in the host. Viruses have to rely on a number of host proteins in order to replicate . In some cases it is probably beneficial for the virus to integrate such genes into their own genome in order to ensure that they are accessible, although there will be a trade off between this advantage and the increased cost of maintaining a larger genome .
        However, there is an alternative hypothesis with respect to the AlkB integration that also has to be considered. As discussed above, the AlkB domain seems to have been integrated relatively recently in viruses found at very different geographical locations, and the only obvious connection seems to be that most viruses belong to a subset of the Flexiviridae. However, the source of these viruses points at another common feature. As seen from the table given in Additional file 1, AlkB domains are often found in viruses associated with grapevine, apple, cherry, citrus and blueberry – crops where the usage of pesticides is common. It is known that several common pesticides (e.g. methyl bromide and some organophosphorus compounds) may cause methylation of DNA and RNA [30-33]. An integrated repair domain for methylation damage as part of the viral replication complex would therefore give the virus a competitive advantage in a highly methylating environment. The application of such pesticides would probably also stimulate AlkB production e.g. in co-infecting bacteria, giving these viruses easy access to AlkB mRNA for integration into their RNA genome.
        It could be argued that a more active PTGS system in these plants would give a similar effect. However, in that case we would expect to see more ancient integrations of AlkB domains. It could also be argued that the presence of AlkB domains may be an artefact caused by promiscuous viral domains picking up available mRNA sequences during cultivation of viruses in the laboratory. However, given the large number of different laboratories involved, and the number of different hosts used (data not shown), this seems to be a very unlikely explanation.
        The hypothesis that environmental compounds, in particular pesticides, may have provoked the integration of AlkB domains into the viral genomes depends upon a high mutation rate and frequent integrations of non-viral domains. The integrations have to be recent, not only in relative terms, compared to other domains in the same genome, but also in absolute terms, compared to the progress of modern agriculture. The integrations also have to be frequent, in the sense that it is likely that integration could have happened several times, in different biotopes.
        It is difficult to estimate mutation rates in RNA viruses. They evolve very rapidly, and it is often difficult to assign reliable phylogenies. However, recent studies indicate that most ssRNA viruses have a mutation rate close to 10-3 substitutions per site per year , e.g. the SARS virus has 1.16–3.30 × 10-3 non-synonymous substitutions per site per year, which is considered to be a ""moderate"" ssRNA mutation rate . If we assume that most ssRNA viruses have effective mutation rates within the same order of magnitude, a realistic mutation rate for the viruses included here might be something like 2.0 × 10-3. In that case, the MT, HEL and RdRp trees shown in Additional file 2 represent approximately between 325 and 750 years of evolution. In general the NJ trees estimate a slightly shorter evolutionary history (between 325 and 450 years) compared to the ML trees (between 550 and 750 years). In this estimate the Ampelovirus sequences have not been included, as they seem to have diverged from the remaining AlkB-containing viruses at a much earlier stage. If we believe that the AlkB integrations happened after the divergence of most sequence included here, as indicated by the lack of co-evolution in Figure 4, it does not seem unrealistic to assume that most of these integrations happened within the last 50 – 100 years or so. This estimate is of course very approximate, in particular since we do not know the true mutation rate of these viruses. However, it shows that a likely time span for AlkB integration is compatible with the evolution of modern agriculture. Unfortunately, because of the lack of any robust phylogeny for the viral AlkB sequences it does not make sense to do a similar estimate for that domain.
        Although it is generally accepted that viruses frequently use recombination to acquire functionality , it is less well known how often this includes nonviral sequences. However, there are some well-documented examples, and in particular the properties of the ssRNA positive-strand Pestivirus may be relevant in this context. There are two biotopes of the pestiviruses, cytopathogenic (cp) and noncytopatogenic (noncp). The host is infected by the noncp form which is converted into the cp form by integration of a fragment of a cellular gene into the viral genome . This introduces a protease cleavage site in the polyprotein. However, the important point here is that this happens as part of the normal infection process. It has been suggested that the integration is facilitated by the viral polymerase undergoing two subsequent template switches during minus-strand synthesis , although nonreplicative RNA recombination also may be a possibility . Integration of cellular sequences have also been observed in other viruses, e.g. in influenza virus . This shows that at least some viruses do have efficient mechanisms for recruitment of host genes into the viral genome. Therefore a recent and rapid integration of AlkB domains into selected plant virus genomes does not seem to be an unlikely scenario.
        This study has focused on the AlkB domain, mainly as an attempt to get a better understanding of potential functions associated with this domain. However, it is likely that additional information about integration patterns and the relative importance of de novo integration vs. recombination can be achieved by a closer investigation of the other variable domains, e.g. by looking at how they correlate with the evolution of the AlkB domains.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      We believe that the viral AlkB-like domains are conventional repair domains targeted towards the viral RNA. The integration of AlkB domains into viral genomes may have been provoked by environmental methylating agents, e.g. the introduction of DNA/RNA-methylating pesticides in farming. The hypothesis  that the domain interferes with the PTGS system of plants can not be excluded, but seems to be less consistent with observed features of the AlkB integration.
    
    
      Methods
      The NCBI nr protein sequence database was searched with PSI-Blast , with the output limited to viral sequences. Multiple alignments were made with ClustalX version 1.8 . The phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 was made from ClustalX alignments by MEGA2 , using the neighbour-joining (NJ) approach with complete deletion of gap positions, Poisson correction of distances and 500 bootstrap steps. Phylogenetic trees for sequence regions from sequences with AlkB domains were made with the NJ approach as described above, but with 10.000 bootstrap steps. Corresponding trees were also made by the maximum likelihood approach (ML) by Tree-Puzzle version 5.2 , using an exact likelihood function, the VT matrix  and 10.000 puzzling steps. The trees from Tree-Puzzle were visualised with TreeView version 1.6.6 , and the NJ and ML trees were compared with Component version 2.0 . Significance of pairwise tree distances were estimated using the data of Day . Pairwise distances between sequences, for comparing evolution of AlkB domains to other viral domains, were computed directly from ClustalX alignments with local tools, using the Blosum50 mutation matrix , but without any correction for multiple substitutions. Motifs in protein sequences were identified using HMMER version 2.3.2  with the Pfam library version 11.0 . A Pfam-type profile for the methyltransferase domains of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae was generated from a ClustalX alignment, using hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate from the HMMER package. Visualisation of motif positions in viral sequences was generated directly from the HMMER output files using a local tool as an interface to the GNU  groff software. Systematic large scale searches with polyprotein subsequences were done locally with PSI-Blast and the NCBI reference sequence database . Dot plots for comparison of viral protein sequences were generated with Dotter version 3.0 .

    The management of infectious diseases in an increasingly complex world of mass international travel, globalization and terrorism heightens challenges for Federal, State and Territory Governments in ensuring that Australia's laws are sufficiently flexible to address the types of problems that may emerge.
    In the 1980's and 1990's HIV/AIDS was the latest ""emerging infectious disease"". Considerable thought was put into the legislative response by a number of Australian jurisdictions. Particular attention had to be given to the unique features of the disease such as the method of transmission, the kinds of people who were at risk, and the protections needed by the community and the infected population to best manage the care of those infected and to minimize new infections. Health workers and researchers began to find that ""the most effective strategies that we have so far found to help promote reduction of the spread of HIV involve the adoption of laws and policies which protect the rights of people most at risk of infection"" . A good example of a legislative response which adopts this approach is found in section 119 and 120 of the Victorian Health Act 1958. These sections emphasize the need to protect the privacy of the infected individual and to undertake a staged response which is proportional to the risk presented by the infected individual. The legislation has been very effective with HIV and has been praised for its progressive approach .
    In 2003 the community has been faced with the emergence of two new infectious diseases, SARS and Anthrax. Whilst there were no cases of either disease in Australia, the threat of a possible outbreak had to be acknowledged and a response planned. Anthrax is not a new infectious disease. Humans can become infected with anthrax by handling products from infected animals or by breathing in anthrax spores from infected animal products (like wool, for example). People also can become infected with gastrointestinal anthrax by eating undercooked meat from infected animals. However, its manufacture and use as a weapon for bioterrorism forces us to rethink its management in a new context.
    These two infectious diseases have very different features from HIV which spreads only via transmission of infected bodily fluids such as blood or semen. SARS, by contrast is transmitted via droplets from infected cases which, as a result of coughing, carry the virus to close contacts  Thus, the infection profile of SARS requires planning for the possible overrun of Intensive Care Units and the likely infection of a number of ICU staff affecting both morale and capacity to cope. Anthrax raised different problems. These include the possible investigation of terrorist suspects alongside investigation of the outbreak of the infectious disease. Difficulties are also raised by likelihood of public panic, and the flooding of public health officials with reports of suspicious white powder.
    In early 2004 the media reported the spread of avian influenza across South East Asia. This disease has different features from HIV/AIDS and SARS and an approach to an Australian outbreak would also be different. The main difference is in the source of transmission of the virus, that is, from infected birds to humans. There is very little difference [from ordinary influenza] in the symptoms (though these may vary in severity) or treatment of the virus  It is too early to predict whether this may be the next ""emerging infectious disease"", but its current spread has given rise to concern about such a possibility 
    Australia is a federal system. There are two parallel sets of laws in operation. The Commonwealth Constitution sets out the legislative powers of the Commonwealth. Specific powers are listed in the Commonwealth constitution but State constitutions have broad powers covering matters such as peace, order and good governance. As the Commonwealth has no specific power to legislate with respect to health, other than the quarantine power, national legislative schemes in public health which rely upon a cooperative approach from all States and Territories are cumbersome and difficult.
    Without a specific head of power, the Commonwealth has limited ability to legislate with respect to health. ""That is, the legislative powers of the Commonwealth are specified in the Constitution and do not include expressly most of the activities that together comprise the field of public health"" For this reason, there are no Commonwealth emergency health powers except quarantine powers. Quarantine powers are currently restricted to isolation at the border of the country of people, plants, and animals to prevent the spread of disease. There is a real possibility that quarantine laws could have a broader scope. It depends on how widely the High Court would interpret section 51(x) of the Commonwealth Constitution. A quarantine law could override state laws as long as it remained a law ""with respect to quarantine"". However, ""the power is potentially a colossus so far as the expansion of legislative authority in the fields of public health is concerned"". 
    The quarantine power would be the most likely candidate for a head of power on which to base development of commonwealth laws for the management of public health emergencies. Another possibility may be the external affairs power, if there was a relevant treaty or international agreement which could be given effect to in domestic law. However the legislation would have to be limited to laws giving effect to the treaty.
    States and territories have a range of emergency powers available to them in their existing public health legislation. Some are relatively old. For example, the Health Act 1911 (WA), Public Health Act 1952 (NT) based on an 1898 Ordinance (Both these Acts are currently under review). Health emergency powers vary from one jurisdiction to another, but include powers to support disease surveillance, contact tracing and orders to restrict behavior or movement of individuals with an infectious disease in certain circumstances. There are also powers to recall food, search premises and seize property, close buildings and a range of other substantial and intrusive powers.
    It is suggested that it is time to consider whether state and territory public health legislation contains sufficient measures to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease in a modern environment which includes mass travel, swift spread of infection and additional complexity raised by fears of bioterrorism.
    Currently, in a public health emergency caused by the spread of an emerging infectious disease, Australia could need to rely on a patchwork of legislative measures to assist it to cope. Commonwealth quarantine laws and State and Territory powers in public health legislation may all be needed to address the problem. If an outbreak occurred on a border, or in some area where jurisdiction may be in doubt such as airspace or offshore and a state or territory response was required in addition to any quarantine measures, there could be confusion over jurisdiction for the application of State and Territory powers. State and Territory public health acts do not adequately provide for interjurisdictional communication and cooperation. There could also be difficulties if an infectious disease caused overseas deaths of people from more than one State or Territory in circumstances where an Australian coronial investigation was considered desirable. In such a situation, the jurisdiction of more than one Australian coroner would be triggered. Several State and Territory coronial laws could apply and there could be different inquests under different laws undertaken by different coroners into the same incident.
    It is suggested that it is time to look at the efficiency of the emergency powers laws of Australia as a whole: to map the laws in each jurisdiction and the Commonwealth quarantine laws and to consider their effectiveness in the face of the outbreak of a fast moving, easily spread infectious disease. The efficacy of Australia's laws should also be considered in relation to bioterrorism. While there were no infections from anthrax in 2003 despite a great deal of media coverage and infections and deaths in the US, a responsible legislature ought to acknowledge the possibility and ensure that the law is ready to support a swift and effective response.
    It is not enough to consider whether the individual pieces of legislation are up to the task of managing outbreaks of newly emerging infectious diseases. Indeed many of the jurisdictions are currently reviewing their public health legislation and will no doubt give proper consideration to this issue as part of the review. But who is thinking about how the legislation of all jurisdictions and the Commonwealth quarantine fits together? What powers enable communication and cooperation between jurisdictions about the outbreak of infectious disease? What kind of opportunity is there for a coordinated response? Can public health orders made in one jurisdiction travel to another jurisdiction when the infected individual travels? What arrangements can be made if an outbreak occurs on or close to a interstate border? What if there is an outbreak on a bus carrying passengers from Victoria, through South Australia to the Northern Territory?
    It is encouraging to note that, even without specific legislation, there has been a mechanism to achieve communication and cooperation between jurisdictions through the Communicable Disease Network of Australia (CDNA). This Network has in fact been quite successful in fostering regular communication between the Communicable Disease Units across the country and has been involved in coordinated actions during a number of multistate outbreaks.
    Despite the existence of this network and other good working relationships between government officials and various agencies in different jurisdictions, a serious outbreak of communicable disease would require the existence of legislative powers. Public health emergencies generate confusion, even panic. Clarity of powers and the way those powers interact with each other would be crucial in an emergency. It became apparent after the Bali tragedy in 2002 that coroner's jurisdiction was triggered differently in different jurisdictions and some acts did not support communication and cooperation when inquests might be needed for deaths of people ordinarily resident in several jurisdictions. The time to find the shortcomings in the legislation is well before the crisis.
    A review of the efficacy of how these laws work together to protect the public health of all Australians should be undertaken. It has been possible to overcome the hangovers of federation for the betterment of all Australians in relation to corporations law. When doubts were recently raised about the constitutional basis of the corporations law scheme, the States and Territories were able to cooperate and refer the necessary powers to the Commonwealth to provide certainty about the laws which govern our corporations. Is our public health any less important than governance of our corporations? Could we cooperate to give ourselves certainty, flexibility and a consistent approach which protects the rights of those subject to some very broad powers?
    The States and Territories are generally reluctant to refer powers to the Commonwealth. It may be time to seriously discuss referral of powers in the context of health emergency powers. At the very least, it is time that the Commonwealth, States and Territories recognised the need for the laws to work as a set of laws to protect the whole country, not simply individual laws to protect individual jurisdictions.
    There has been work done internationally in this area. A model State Emergency Health Powers Act has been developed in the US in 2001  In the preamble to this Act a rationale for its development is set out: ""In the wake of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, our nation realizes that the Government's foremost responsibility is to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of its citizens. New and emerging dangers including emergent and resurgent infectious diseases and incidents of civilian mass casualties – pose serious and immediate threats to the population. A renewed focus on the prevention, detection, management and containment of public health emergencies is thus called for."" The US, like Australia, is a Federal system. The model was intended to be taken up by those US states which wished to do so. To date, it has been passed in over half the US states. This bill would be an excellent starting point for development of an Australian model. There are a number of legislative mechanisms which could be used to support a nationally uniform approach to health emergency powers legislation in Australia.
    The development and adoption of the model food legislation provides a useful model of a cooperative uniform approach. A model act was developed in consultation with all jurisdictions. It covered areas agreed to be core areas of the Act which ought to be the subject of a national approach and other provisions which were considered to be administrative and were to be adopted at the discretion of each jurisdiction. An intergovernmental agreement was signed as a mechanism to protect the uniformity of the legislation. The agreement sets up a Ministerial Council, supported by a Food Regulation Standing Committee. The Council has responsibility for deciding on proposals to amend the model  If a decision is made in favor of amendment, States and Territories will use their best endeavors to submit to their respective Parliaments, legislation which gives effect to the amendment.
    The law is an important tool in supporting the management of the outbreak of infectious diseases. The existence of our Federal system has meant that we have a different approach in each State and Territory together with Commonwealth control of quarantine. Newly emerging infectious diseases creating real threats to public health in an era of easy mass travel, and the present threat of bioterrorism mean that it is time Australia examined all laws to contain and manage infectious disease outbreak. The laws should be examined both for their effectiveness in the areas they cover, and as part of a whole which ought enable a response which protects the health of all Australians, and crosses borders as easily as SARS or avian influenza.

      Introduction
      Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are anaerobic Gram positive bacteria with a GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status. They are also food grade bacteria, and therefore, they can be used for the delivery of proteins of interest in foodstuff or in the digestive tract. A last advantage compared to other well-known protein producers is that L. lactis does not produce LPS or any proteases as Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis do, respectively.
      In the last two decades, genetic tools for the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis, were developed: transformation protocols, cloning- or screening-vectors , and mutagenesis systems  are now available. Moreover L. lactis genome is entirely sequenced . Many protein expression- and targeting-systems have also been designed for L. lactis [5-7]. These systems have been used to engineer L. lactis for the intra- or extra-cellular production of numerous proteins of viral, bacterial or eukaryotic origins (Table 1). To produce a protein of interest in fermentors, secretion is generally preferred to cytoplasmic production because it allows continuous culture and simplifies purification. To use L. lactis as a protein delivery vehicle in the digestive tract of humans or animals, secretion is also preferable because it facilitates interaction between the protein (e.g. enzyme or antigen) and its target (substrate or immune system).

      In LAB, like in other Gram positive bacteria, secreted proteins are synthesized as a precursor containing an N-terminal extension called the signal peptide (SP) and the mature moiety of the protein. Precursors are recognized by the host secretion machinery and translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane (early steps). The SP is then cleaved and degraded, and the mature protein is released in the culture supernatant (late steps). Sometimes, secreted proteins require subsequent folding and maturation steps to acquire their active conformation .
      In most of the works describing heterologous protein production by recombinant lactococci, only one cellular-location (i.e. cytoplasm, external media or surface anchored) is described. Only a few works report the production of a given protein in different locations using the same backbone vector, the same induction level and or promoter strength, allowing thus a rigorous comparison of the production yields of cytoplasmic and secreted forms.
      Here, six examples of different heterologous proteins produced in L. lactis in both secreted and cytoplasmic forms are reviewed and discussed. Our major conclusion is that the best production yields are observed in most of these cases with secretion (up to five-fold higher than with cytoplasmic production). Moreover, engineering the expression cassette to enhance the secretion efficiency (SE, proportion of the total protein detected as mature form in the supernatant) resulted in increased overall amounts of the protein. L. lactis is able to secrete proteins ranging from low-(< 10 kDa) to high-(> 160 kDa) molecular mass through a Sec-dependant pathway. Altogether, these observations suggest that i) heterologous proteins produced in L. lactis are prone to intracellular degradation whereas secretion allows the precursor to escape proteolysis, and ii) conformation rather than protein size is the predominant feature that can impair SE. New perspectives are now opened in the studies of heterologous protein production in L. lactis. Indeed, there is a need for food grade systems and for a better understanding of the host factors influencing heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis . For example, HtrA-mediated proteolysis (HtrA is the unique housekeeping protease at the cell surface) is now well-characterized in L. lactis  and can be overcome by use of a htrA L. lactis strain designed for stable heterologous protein secretion . However, intracellular proteolysis (involving Clp complex -the major cytoplasmic housekeeping protease-, and probably other cellular components) remains poorly understood and is also discussed here.

      Genetic tools to target a given protein in different cellular compartments were developed using several reporter proteins [6,11-13] (Table 1). The staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) is a well-characterized secreted protein whose activity is readily detectable by petri plate assay and it has been used as a reporter protein for secretion studies in several Gram positive hosts [14-16]. In L. lactis, Nuc was used to develop protein targeting-  and SP screening-systems . Nuc was chosen to develop the pCYT and pSEC vectors for controlled production in L. lactis of cytoplasmic or secreted forms of a protein of interest, respectively (Fig. 1) . The pCYT and pSEC plasmids, where expression is controlled by a nisin inducible promoter, should be used in L. lactis NZ9000 (hereafter referred to as NZ) strain bearing a nisR,K chromosomal cassette, required for the nisin signal transduction . In each case described below, protein sample concentration was adjusted to the cell density of the producing culture (for details see ). At similar induction levels in lactococcal strains containing pCYT:Nuc and pSEC:Nuc vectors, the highest production yields were observed with the secreted Nuc form (Table 2). Similar results were obtained with constitutive nuc expression cassettes for cytoplasmic and secreted forms. Nuc was the first heterologous protein where highest protein yields were obtained with the secreted form.

Arrows (1) indicate the presence of the nisin-inducible promoter (PnisA); solid vertical bars (2) indicate the Ribosome Binding Site of the usp45 gene; the striped bar indicate signal peptide of the usp45 gene (SPUsp); the white bar indicates the insertion of LEISSTCDA synthetic propeptide ; dark gray bars indicates Nuc mature coding sequence; stem-loop structures indicate trpA transcription terminators (not to scale). A NsiI restriction site comprises the ATG start codon (in pCYT) or the last two residues of SPUsp (pSEC) and allows a simple and one-step cloning of the cassettes corresponding to the mature proteins for cytoplasmic production (pCYT) or secretion (pSEC).

      Similar results were obtained for the production of a Brucella abortus ribosomal protein. B. abortus is a facultative intracellular Gram negative bacterial pathogen that infects human and animals by entry through the digestive tract. The immunogenic B. abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate for the development of oral live vaccines against brucellosis using L. lactis as a delivery vector. L7/L12 was produced in L. lactis using pCYT and pSEC vectors . Similarly to Nuc production, the production yield of secreted L7/L12 was reproducibly and significantly higher than that of the cytoplasmic form (Table 2).
      Another example of higher protein yields in secreted vs cytoplasmic form is the production the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen, a good candidate for the development of therapeutic vaccines against HPV-16 induced cervical cancer. The E7 protein is constitutively produced in cervical carcinomas and interacts with several cell compounds. E7 was produced in a cytoplasmic and a secreted form in L. lactis . Using similar induction level in exponential phase cultures, E7 production was higher for the secreted form than for the cytoplasmic form (Table 2). This difference was even higher when induction occurred in late-exponential phase, where intracellular E7 was detected at only trace amount whereas secreted E7 was accumulated in NZ(pSEC:E7) culture supernatant (see below). Thus, production of E7 clearly illustrates the fact that secretion results in higher yields in L. lactis.
      Production of ovine interferon omega (IFN-ω) further illustrates this observation. In the case of poorly immunogenic antigens, co-delivery of an immuno-stimulator protein can enhance the immune response of the host. In order to optimize the use of lactococci as live vaccines, the production of cytokines was investigated in L. lactis . IFN-ω is a cytokine able to confer resistance to enteric viruses in the digestive tract by reduction of viral penetration and by inhibition of intracellular multiplication of the viruses. Delivery of ovine IFN-ω in the digestive tract by recombinant L. lactis strains could therefore induce anti-viral resistance and could protect the enterocytes. Ovine IFN-ω cDNA was cloned into pCYT and pSEC plasmids for intracellular (pCYT:IFN) and secreted (pSEC:IFN) production respectively . Induction of recombinant NZ(pCYT:IFN) and NZ(pSEC:IFN) strains were performed at equal level and IFN-ω production was measured. The levels of IFN-ω activity showed that i) an active form of IFN-ω was produced in both strains, and ii) the activity of IFN-ω found in the supernatant and cell fractions of NZ(pSEC:IFN) strain was about two-fold higher than that observed for the cytoplasmic form (Table 2). Similarly to what was observed for Nuc and E7, secretion leads to higher heterologous protein yields.
    
    
      Better secretion for better yields
      L. lactis has been engineered to secrete of a wide variety of heterologous proteins from bacterial, viral or eukaryotic origins (Table 1). There are reports about secretion bottlenecks and biotechnological tools for heterologous secretion in model bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis , but only few data are available concerning this aspect in L. lactis. Protein size, nature of the SP and presence of a propeptide are parameters that may interfere with protein secretion. Some data available about these features are compiled here.
      To optimize secretion and thus production yields, the nature of the SP was the first parameter to modify on heterologous precursor as previously shown using Nuc as a reporter protein. The replacement of the native staphylococcal SPNuc by the homologous lactococcal SPUsp45 to direct the secretion of Nuc in L. lactis led to an increased SE  (Table 3). On the other hand, the replacement of SPNuc by SPUsp45 did not enhance the SE of NucT (a truncated mature moiety of Nuc devoid of N-terminal propeptide) suggesting the importance of the propeptide in the SE for Nuc  (Table 3). However, in several cases, the use of a homologous SP (and especially SPUsp45) allows a better SE compared to a heterologous one. Screening vectors were thus developed to search for new homologous secretion signals in L. lactis . These screening works offer now a panel of SPs that are suitable for heterologous secretion. However, when compared to SPUsp45, the newly described SPs were less efficient to direct secretion of Nuc . Even after a direct mutagenesis on SP310, one of these new SPs identified using a screening strategy , the enhanced SE was still lower than the one measured with SPUsp45 . However, a recent study by Lindholm et al. showed that a Lactobacillus brevis SP (originated from a S-layer protein) drove the secretion of the E. coli FedF adhesin more efficiently than SPUsp45 . High SE might thus result, at least in part, from good adequacy between the mature protein and the SP used to direct secretion.

          a: SE, secretion efficiency is the proportion of total protein which is present in the mature secreted form.
          b: SE was not determined by western blot and immuno revelation and thus could not be quantified but the activity plate assay demonstrated a clear secretion enhancement (+ to +++) with LEISS.
        
      
      The fusion of a short synthetic propeptide between the SP and the mature moiety is another innovative biotechnological tool to enhance protein secretion. One such propeptide (composed of nine amino acid residues, LEISSTCDA) was developed and was shown to enhance the SE of several heterologous proteins in L. lactis: NucB, NucT, (Table 3) , the B. abortus L7/L12 antigen (Table 3) , and the α-amylase of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Table 3) . Directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the positive effect of LEISSTCDA on protein secretion was due to the insertion of negatively charged residues in the N-terminus of the mature moiety . Furthermore, the enhancement effect does not depend on the nature of the SP, since the secretion of NucB fused to either SPNuc or SPUsp45 was enhanced by LEISSTCDA insertion . Strikingly, the enhancement of SE was reproducibly accompanied by an overall increase of protein yields as determined in Western blot experiments. This observation suggests that heterologous precursors are degraded by intracellular proteases when they are not efficiently secreted and that a higher secretion could be a way to escape proteolysis.
    
    
      Protein conformation rather than protein size can impair the heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis
      Proteins with molecular mass ranging from 165 kDa (size of DsrD, the Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase, ) to 9.8 kDa (size of Afp1, a Streptomyces tendae anti-fungal protein; Freitas et al., submitted) have been successfully secreted in L. lactis. This suggests that protein size is not a serious bottleneck for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis. In contrast to protein size, conformation may be a major problem for heterologous secretion in L. lactis as illustrated by some recent examples. The first example is the production of the non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of the bovine rotavirus, the major etiologic agent of severe diarrhea in young cattle. In order to develop live vaccines against this virus, the NSP4 antigen was successfully produced in L. lactis . Derivatives of pCYT and pSEC plasmids were constructed to target NSP4 into cytoplasmic or extracellular location. The highest level of production was obtained with the secreted form. However, no secreted NSP4 was detected in the supernatant and both SPUsp45-NSP4 precursor and NSP4 mature protein were detected in the cell fraction. Two degradation products were detected in addition to the NSP4 precursor and mature protein. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic form of NSP4 was probably totally degraded inside the cell whereas fusion to the SPUsp45 protected NSP4 protein against intracellular proteolysis.
      Similar results were obtained when pCYT and pSEC vectors were used to produce the B. abortus GroEL chaperone protein: only pSEC:GroEL plasmid was obtained and subsequently the fusion SPUsp45:GroEL was detected in Western blot experiments (V. Azevedo, unpublished data). In this case, B. abortus GroEL is likely to interact with lactococcal cytoplasmic proteins leading to severe cellular defects and thus to a lethal phenotype. On the other hand, fusion of SPUsp to GroEL might keep the chimeric protein in an unfolded and/or inactive state allowing thus its heterologous production.
      Another example is the production of the bovine β-lactoglobulin (BLG) in L. lactis . BLG, a 162 amino acid residues globular protein, is the dominant allergen in cow's milk and was produced in L. lactis to test the immunomodulation of the allergenic response in mice when BLG is delivered by a bacterial vector . Western blot and ELISA showed that BLG production was significantly higher when BLG was fused to SPUsp45 although the SE was very low, with no detectable BLG in the supernatant of pSEC:BLG strains . Further studies revealed that a fusion between the LEISS propeptide and BLG could not enhance the SE of BLG above ~5%, as determined by ELISA .
      For rotavirus NSP4, B. abortus GroEL, and BLG (which are medium-sized compared to DsrD or Afp1), either very low secretion yields or absence of secretion was observed in L. lactis. In all cases, fusion to a SP stabilizes heterologous protein production even though they are not efficiently secreted. These results could be due either to the SP itself that reportedly acts as an intramolecular chaperone or to the protection of the chimeric precursor from intracellular proteolysis by the cytoplasmic chaperones of the Sec-machinery. GroEL (a cytoplasmic chaperone), NSP4 (a structural protein), and BLG (a globular protein) have dramatically different primary sequences. A higher affinity of intracellular housekeeping proteases for these particular sequences cannot be hypothesized since the fusion of a SP leads to the stabilization of the protein. Change of conformation is therefore the predominant criterion involved in the stabilization of the precursors and the higher yields observed. On the other hand, these proteins might undergo rapid folding right after their synthesis, which interferes with (or hampers) the secretion process. Such interferences between protein conformation and SE were previously shown in E. coli and B. subtilis . Altogether, these results suggest that protein conformation rather than protein size is a major problem for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis as well.
    
    
      A labile protein can be stabilized by fusion to a stable protein
      It was clearly demonstrated that the secreted form of E7, a reportedly labile protein, can be stabilized by fusion to Nuc . Nuc is reportedly a stable protein and its use, as a fusion partner, does not affect its enzymatic activity. The production of the resulting chimerical protein is thus easy to follow. The cytoplasmic form of E7 was stabilized by the fusion to Nuc even when the production was induced in stationary phase (Fig. 2A), whereas cytoplasmic E7 alone was degraded (see below; Fig. 3). Thus, fusion to the stable Nuc could rescue E7 production in L. lactis and allowed higher protein yields compared to E7 alone . Stabilization by fusion to Nuc was observed for several secreted proteins as well. First, a Nuc-E7 fusion on a pSEC backbone resulted in higher production yield although the SE was altered (Fig. 2B). Fusion to the synthetic propeptide LEISSTCDA in a pSEC:LEISS:Nuc:E7 construction restored an efficient secretion yield . Second, in an attempt to increase the protein yield of the secreted L7/L12, a fusion to Nuc (pSEC:Nuc:L7/L12) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in production yield (Fig. 2B) . Recent results concerning the production of BLG provide a third example of yield enhancement by fusion to Nuc. A pSEC:Nuc:BLG construction allowed a 2-fold increase in BLG yields compared to pSEC:BLG . These results show that Nuc is a stable carrier protein and has a protective effect on labile heterologous chimerical proteins by reducing its sensitivity to intracellular proteolysis. To our knowledge, Nuc is the fusion partner most commonly tested so far for stabilization in L. lactis. Bernasconi et al (2002) fused the Lactobacillus bulgaricus proteinase PrtB to BLG, which was subsequently stabilized by the PrtB carrier . It is thus difficult to postulate any rule concerning the stabilization effect. Different results (i.e. no stabilization) could perhaps be observed with a different partner and thus could help to determine the mechanism of the stabilization effect. In biotechnological use of recombinant L. lactis strains for protein production, fusions can also facilitate purification (e.g. His-tag strategy). Protein fusion has also been successfully used to optimize the production of the two subunits of heterodimeric complexes as demonstrated with murine interleukin-12 in L. lactis  or with heterodimeric enzymes in E. coli . In both cases, the resulting fusion had the expected properties. In other cases however, such fusions might dramatically interfere with the conformation of one or both of the proteins, which might be deleterious for the expected activity. Nevertheless, when L. lactis is used as an antigen delivery vector, fusions can be envisioned since it was demonstrated that both moieties of the chimerical protein are still recognized by the corresponding antiserum  and are immunogenic .

          Native E7 production in wt L. lactis depends on growth phase. E7 production and secretion were analyzed by Western blot from cultures induced at different times so that, 1 hour after nisin induction, the samples are harvested at exponential (OD600 = 0.5–0.6, upper panels) or stationary phase (OD600 = 1.5, lower panels). wt/pCYT-E7, NZ(pCYT-E7) strain (encoding native E7, cytoplasmic form). wt/pSEC-E7 NZ(pSEC-E7) strain (encoding the precursor preE7). Positions of E7 mature and precursor forms are given by arrows. C, cell lysates; S, supernatant fraction. ClpP is not involved in the intracellular degradation of E7 in L. lactis. Analysis by western blot shows that a strain of L. lactis deficient in the intracellular protease ClpP cannot rescue cytoplasmic E7 production. Induced cultures samples of wt L. lactis or L. lactis clpP mutant strain containing pCYT-E7 (clpP/pCYT-E7) or pSEC-E7 (clpP/pSEC-E7) taken at exponential- (upper panel) or stationary- (lower panel) phase.
        
        
      
    
    
      Secretion avoids proteolysis?
      Several of the results mentioned above suggest that secretion could be an efficient way to escape intracellular proteolysis. This hypothesis was particularly tested in E7 production . E7 was indeed degraded when intracellular production was induced in late exponential or early stationary growth phase (Fig. 3). E7 production was then tested in a clpP deficient strain (ClpP is reportedly the major house keeping protease in L. lactis; ) and in a dnaK deficient strain (DnaK is an intracellular chaperone that may promote proteolysis by maintaining the protein in an unfolded state; ). In exponential or stationary phase cultures, no significant difference in E7 patterns was observed between wild type and clpP- (Fig. 3) or dnaK- (not shown) strains: E7 was equally degraded in the cytoplasm and remained unchanged in supernatants samples. Altogether, these results indicate that E7 intracellular proteolysis is ClpP- and DnaK- independent. Until recently, only two cytoplasmic proteases, ClpP and FtsH , have been identified in L. lactis. The existence of a third, as yet unidentified protease was postulated by studies of a clpP mutant suppressor . E7 may thus be a useful screening target to identify a putative L. lactis protease that, as suggested by our data, is activated in stationary phase.
      Besides the features of the precursor itself, these results also rise that host factors are involved in protein stability and SE (Fig. 4). Research efforts are now focusing on the analysis of host factors involved in protein production and secretion by either directed or random mutagenesis in L. lactis .

      Although L. lactis possesses a wide range of enzymes (peptidases, housekeeping proteases) dedicated to intracellular proteolysis, it possesses only one extracellular housekeeping protease (HtrA)  and its major extracellular scavenger protease, PrtP, is plasmid encoded . Thus, a plasmidless strain does not present any protease activity in the medium. Better production yields could then be expected when secretion is used versus cytoplasmic production. These results give clues and provide the research workers with target proteins to study intracellular proteolysis and protein stability inside and outside the host strain. Such studies already led to the development of htrA deficient L. lactis strains. Heterologous protein secretion and anchoring in a htrA deficient strain allowed higher protein stability at the cell surface for several heterologous proteins .
    
    
      Perspectives
      Current research works are now focusing on other host factors that affect protein production and secretion in L. lactis. L. lactis complete genome sequence analysis revealed indeed that the Sec machinery comprises fewer components than the well-characterized B. subtilis Sec machinery. Notably, L. lactis does not possess any SecDF equivalent and complementation of the lactococcal Sec machinery with B. subtilis SecDF results in better secretion yields as determined for Nuc reporter protein (Nouaille et al., submitted). Random mutagenesis approaches also revealed that features of some cell compartment, such as the cell wall, play an important role in the secretion process . Similar approaches allowed the identification and characterization of genes of unknown functions specifically involved in production yields of the secreted proteins in L. lactis (Nouaille et al., in preparation).
      Many molecular tools are now available to direct heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis and the list of heterologous proteins produced in this bacterium is regularly increased. The reports where cytoplasmic and secretion production can be compared mostly show that secretion allows better protein yields compared to intracellular production; and allow a better understanding of the protein production and secretion process in L. lactis.
      Future works should investigate the L. lactis capacities for protein modifications. For example, we showed that proteins that require a disulfide bond (DSB) to acquire their native conformation can be efficiently produced and secreted in L. lactis . However, no equivalent of E. coli dsb or B. subtilis bdb, the genes involved in DSB formation, was found by sequence comparison in L. lactis. Similarly, other folding elements (i.e. PPIases, so-called maturases...) are still to be identified and the L. lactis capacities for post-translational modifications are still to be investigated.
      Altogether, these works will contribute to the development and the improvement of new food-grade systems for L. lactis  and should lead, in a near future, to the construction of lactococcal strains dedicated to high-level production of proteins of interest. The GRAS status of L. lactis and LAB in general, is a clear advantage for their use in production and secretion of therapeutic or vaccinal proteins.

  INTRODUCTIONIt is now widely admitted that actual genomes have a common ancestor (LUCA, Last Universal Common Ancestor). Their current diversity results from events that have modified genomes during evolution. While some of these events happen at the nucleotide level (point mutation, indel of few nucleotides), others [strand inversion, duplications, repetitions, transpositions and horizontal transfers (HTs)] may concern significant parts of the genome. It has been postulated that HTs (exchange of genetic material between two different species) were very frequent during the first stages of evolution and are essentially subsisting nowadays in prokaryotes (1–4). As a consequence, the detection of HTs appears crucial to the understanding of the evolutionary processes and to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of exchange rate between species (5–9).The recent complete sequencing of several genomes allows to systematically search for the presence of DNA transfers in species, especially in prokaryotes where the probability of occurrence is higher (10–14). It has been reported in particular that (i) HTs in bacteria account for up to 25% of the genome (8,14–16); (ii) archaebacteria and non-pathogenic bacteria are more prone to transfers than pathogenic bacteria (15,16); and (iii) operational genes are more likely transferred than genes dealing with information management (15–17).The HT concept has been originally coined to explain the dramatic homologies between genes of unrelated species (18,19). An ‘unusual’ match is subsequently the criteria for the detection of HTs (20,21). While this approach allows detection of gene transfers with only a partial knowledge of genomes, it requires the sequencing of homologous genes in a number of species and consequently cannot be used for HT screening.Genes from a given species are very similar to one another with respect to base composition, codon biases and short oligonucleotide composition (15,16,22–24). As a general rule, usage of oligonucleotides varies less along genomes than among genomes (24–27). In addition, it has been observed that transferred DNA retains (at least for some time) characteristics from its species of origin (8,14). These particularities are used alone or in conjunction to detect DNA transfers between species (8,12,13). Transferred DNA is consequently detected on the basis of some of its singularities with respect to the sequence characteristics of the recipient species. However, these techniques suffer several drawbacks and weaknesses (28–30) that led us to consider generalizing the above approach for the screening of atypical regions in sequences. In fact, the genomic signature that accounts for all possible biases in DNA sequences has been shown to be species-specific (26,27,31,32). The signature is approximately invariant along the genome in such a way that the species of origin of DNA segments as small as 1 kb could be identified with a surprisingly high efficiency by means of their signatures (25,27). As a consequence, the sequence signature may be most often (at least in bacteria) considered a valuable estimation of the genomic signature. Assuming that (i) transferred DNA fragments exhibit signature of the species they come from and (ii) recipient and donor signatures are different, the screening of local variations of signature along genomes is expected to reveal regions of interest where HTs might be located. In addition, the status of HT is strongly suggested if the signatures of these regions of interest are found close to the signature of other species.MATERIALS AND METHODSSequence signatureThe sequence signature is defined as the frequencies of the whole set of short oligonucleotides observed in a sequence (26,31). It can be easily obtained thanks to a very fast algorithm derived from the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) (33), which allows coping with a 1 Mb sequence in a few seconds on a laptop computer. Signatures may be visualized as square images where the color (or gray level) of each pixel represents the frequency of a given oligonucleotide (called word thereafter) (31) (for examples of signatures, see Supplementary Materials 2, 4 and 6).DNA sequencesDNA sequences are gathered from GenBank. The genomes of 22 prokaryotes are scanned for HTs, B.subtilis, E.coli and H.influenzae genomes being given a special attention to illustrate our approach. In particular, B.subtilis and E.coli provide valuable benchmark thanks to the set of previous works addressing that very issue (12,14,16,34–37). Signatures of about 12 000 species are obtained from genomic sequences longer than 1.5 kb. Sequences derived from the same species are concatenated for accuracy purposes. Species from the three domains of life, archaea (∼260 species), bacteria (∼3950 species) and eukarya (∼6750 species) as well as viruses (∼1300 species), are represented for a total amount of 1.0 Gb.DNA samplingThe detection of atypical regions is based on the observation of deviation of local signatures (i.e. signature of small fragments of DNA) from the genomic signature of the recipient species. Genomes are consequently sampled by means of a sliding window with an appropriate size. In fact, it would be interesting to have windows the smallest as possible for highest sampling accuracy. However, intra-genomic variability of signature increases for small windows. In addition, variability depends on species and word length. Base composition (1-letter word), 2- and 3-letter words are poorly species-specific: they do not allow a good discrimination between species (25,27). As a general rule, the longer the words (up to 9-letter long), the higher the specificity of the signature (25,27,31). However, counts of long words in small windows are too low to allow a reliable estimation of the parameters. In our hands, the analysis of 4-letter words in a sliding window of 5 kb (with a 0.5 kb step) offers a good trade-off between reliability of count, file size and computational charge, whatever the species. In addition, a double-strand signature (called local signature thereafter) is computed for each window to get rid of variations induced by strand asymmetry (38–42).For illustration purposes, local signatures are developed as vertical vectors and stacked together in genome order to give an overall picture of word usage variations along each genome. In such plots, horizontal lines show the variation in frequency of words along the genome, whereas local changes in word usage appear as vertical breaks (Figure 1).Recipient species signatureConsidering that the greatest part of the genome is species-typical, the signature of the recipient species might have been estimated from the analysis of the whole sequence. Although the vast majority of local signatures look mostly the same (believed to be instances of the recipient species signature), some of them may greatly differ. In order to avoid potential biases linked to these outliers, it has been subsequently decided to select typical local signatures on the basis of their similarities, observed after clustering. The underlying idea is that typical local signatures aggregate in few large groups, whereas outliers are found in small complementary groups at a great distance from the recipient genome signature. Groups were consequently determined with the K-means clustering tool, using every scheme of clusters between 3 and 8 for each species. Finally, the best scheme of clusters was obtained by a decision tree-based partition [CART algorithm (43)]. The purpose of the CART algorithm is to predict values of a categorical dependent variable (clusters of local signatures in this work, each signature being characterized by its distance to the estimated genomic signature) from one or more continuous and/or categorical predictor variables [the different clustering schemes (3–8 clusters) in this work]. The CART algorithm thus provides an optimal split between groups collecting signatures close to the estimated recipient genome signature and the others groups. For each species, a clustering scheme is selected (e.g. the 5-group clustering) and a partition offered (continued example: group 2 and 3 on one side; 1, 4 and 5 on the other). The recipient species signature is subsequently calculated as the mean of the signatures of the groups belonging to the partition with the smallest distance to the estimated genomic signature.Atypical regionsComparison of signatures is made possible, thanks to an Euclidian metric, accounting for differences in word usage. It must be pointed out that distances between signatures are calculated for high dimensional data (256 dimensions corresponding to the 256 different 4-letter words) and are consequently subjected to the so-called ‘concentration of measure phenomenon’ (44). All distances in a high dimension space seem to be comparable since they increase with the square root of the dimension of the space, whereas the variance of their distribution remains unchanged. In fact, the radius of the hyper sphere holding 99% of the signatures of our database is only seven times the nearest neighbor distance (smallest distance between two species). Small differences in distance may consequently be considered highly significant.For each species, a set of recipient-specific distances is obtained, every local signature belonging to the large clusters being given a distance to the host signature. In order to select outlying signatures, a cut-off distance is chosen on the basis of the distribution of distances observed for each species. It appears that the 99% percentile offered a good trade-off between sensibility and specificity for outlier detection (for impact of the threshold on detection of atypical regions, see Results). Most signatures from minority clusters are detected in this way. Isolated signatures are detected as well, while very few signatures from the recipient species clusters are selected (1%). Outliers together with the flanking regions on the genome are later on reanalyzed with smaller window and step (1/10th of the original size typically) in order to more accurately determine their limits, when signal-to-noise ratio allows it.Finally, the gene content of all detected regions is analyzed with the help of species dedicated databases [Genome Information Broker, ]. A BlastN search (GenBank, default settings) is carried out for each atypical region in order to identify the origin of potential HTs if homology is high enough.Search for the origin of atypical regionsAbout 12 000 species (including chromosomal, plasmidic, mitochondrial and chloroplastic DNA) from GenBank are found eligible for a genomic signature. Given the signature of an atypical DNA fragment, species with a close signature might be considered as potential donors. Such a screening is performed for every atypical region of the 22 species under consideration. The first five nearby species are retained when their distance to the outlier was donor-compatible.RESULTSA total of 22 genomes are screened for atypical regions (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1). On the average, the 6-cluster scheme offers the best partition. However, in a single case (Aeropyrum pernix), nine clusters are required. In general, a single cluster is devoted to rRNA. The mean distance of windows to host varies over species from 121 to 145 (mean = 132, coefficient of variation = 3%). It is tightly correlated (P-value for the Pearson correlation coefficient <10−4) with the cut-off distance that varies from 178 to 289 (mean = 234, coefficient of variation = 14%). Such large variations can hardly be explained on the mere basis of statistical fluctuations. As already observed (31,45,46), variation of oligonucleotides usage along genome depends on species and can consequently be considered as a species property.Segmentation quality of atypical regions can be tested using rRNA genes. About 94% of rRNA is detected as atypical (Table 1). Borders of rRNA genes are accurate to within 130 nt (0.5 kb window and 50 bp step, threshold 99%). Meanwhile, adjacent tRNAs are identified as well. As a general rule, it can be concluded that rRNA has a specific signature that is consistently at variance with the host signature. In this context, it is worth noticing that rRNA and the remaining outliers lie at comparable distances from the species they belong to, but they are clearly different from one another, rRNAs being consistently found in their own cluster.The percentage of RNA-free outliers (at the nucleotide level) varies from 1.3 to 13% as a function of species (threshold 99%, Table 1). B.subtilis shows the highest percentage of atypical regions, whereas Pyrococcus abyssi has the lowest. Percentages among species are found correlated with the cut-off distance: the higher the cut-off distance, the lower the percentage of outliers (P = 0.007). In fact, a high cut-off distance takes place in species that display a high intra-genomic variability, also expressed by a high mean distance to the host (Table 1). Whether the actual percentage of atypical DNA is an intrinsic property of the species or a mere consequence of the resolution power of nucleotide biases-based methods remains consequently an open question. In addition, as already observed (13,14), the percentage of outliers is significantly higher for longer genomes (P = 0.004), whereas the cut-off distance is not related to the length of the genome (P = 0.69).The mean cut-off distance for the 22 species is 234 (Table 1). This value is chosen to select credible donors. About 50% of atypical regions are subsequently given credible donors (Supplementary Material 1). Each species has it own set of potential donors (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1). In general, donors share the species' biotope. For example, it is remarkable that half of the B.subtilis' potential donors are firmicutes (Table 1). Many plasmids and viruses are also found in agreement with the known molecular mechanisms of horizontal transfer (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 1).B.subtilis genome analysisA clustering with three classes allows assessing the signature of B.subtilis. The most populated class (collecting 84% of the segments) is chosen to represent B.subtilis. For this sub-population, the mean distance (arbitrary unit) to the recipient (centroid of the class) and the cut-off distance are 126 and 204, respectively (Table 1). Runs of contiguous outlying windows sharing the same cluster are considered as single transfer events. As a consequence, 58 regions (Figure 2a and Supplementary Material 2) fall beyond the cut-off distance and are thus potential candidates for hosting foreign DNA (for a segmentation of the B.Subtilis genome in terms of genes, see Supplementary Material 3). Figure 2b illustrates the accuracy of segmentation of an atypical region obtained by using a sliding window of 0.5 kb with a 50 bp step.rRNA genes make up ∼1.1% of B.subtilis genome (Table 1). All rRNA genes are found in the outlier population. In addition, all windows containing rRNA are assigned to a specific cluster. In fact, it is known that rRNA has its own signature, which is at variance from the host signature (12). rRNA genes account for 7% of the outliers (tRNAs are not considered in this study, because their size is too small to generate a significant deviation from the host signature if they are isolated).A total of 86% of the B.subtilis genome should be considered as B.subtilis typical (Table 1). When looking for the origin of B.subtilis segments in the 12 000 signature database, B.subtilis appears in the 10 first potential donors for 84% of the whole set of 5 kb sequences that can be derived from its genome. This result confirms that segments having signatures belonging to the predominant clusters are good representatives of the recipient species signature.The 49 rRNA-free atypical regions vary in size from 1.5 to 135 kb and make up 13% of the total genome (Table 1). About 50% of atypical regions are less than (or around) 6 kb long. Distances of outlier from first potential donor often fall within the intra-genomic range (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 2): 75% of B.subtilis atypical regions have first donors lying at a distance <234 (mean cut-off distance for the 22 species analyzed in this paper). Potential donors are clearly distinct from B.subtilis (Supplementary Material 2). Although outliers are distributed all over the genome, several types can be distinguished on the basis of their signatures; potential donors seem to come from a few sets of species with similar signatures (Table 1 and Supplementary Material 2). The most important cluster includes bacteriophage SPBc2 and its neighbors, another concerns the Enterococcus genus.However, in some instances, the outlier-to-donor distance is too great to consider the ‘closest’ species as potential donor. In contrast, unusual small values deserve a specific attention. In particular, the very small distance between bacteriophage SPBc2 and ‘2150751–2285750’ atypical region (d = 2) allows to spot the part of B.subtilis genome where bacteriophage SPBc2 is incorporated (12,47). Other regions in the genome are also found similar (in terms of signature) to bacteriophage SPBc2. Most of them correspond to bacteriophages, imbedded in B.subtilis genome, whose free forms are not sequenced (12,47). Observed similarities with SPBC2 are, however, expected since signatures of phages usually share some characteristics with the species they infect (48). The SPBc2 sequence is the only foreign sequence identified in B.subtilis, using homology as criterion (BlastN, with parameters set to default). In fact, Blast analysis of B.subtilis outliers leads to contrasted results. Besides SPBc2 and 7 out of 9 prophages imbedded in the genome, the only atypical regions identified are those containing the 30 rRNA genes coded in B.subtilis genome. The only few genes that are homologous to parts of atypical regions are found in species belonging to the Bacillus genus. It is interesting to note that no house-keeping genes (except rRNA) are detected in atypical regions. In fact, a great number of genes in atypical regions (except bacteriophage genes and rRNA) have no known function.H.influenzae genome analysisA clustering with five classes is required to determine the recipient species signature of H.influenzae. The three most populated classes (collecting 94% of the segments) are chosen to calculate the H.influenzae signature. Mean distance to host and cut-off distance is subsequently found equal to 130 and 239, respectively (Table 1). Similarly to B.subtilis, one cluster (1.5% of H.influenzae genome) is devoted to the 18 rRNA gene copies (Table 1). A total of 91% of rRNA is labeled atypical and account for 29% of the outliers.Analysis of Table 1 shows that 95% of the H.influenzae genome should be considered as H.influenzae typical. In fact, H.influenzae is one of the 10 first potential donors for 92% of all 5 kb sequences that can be derived from its genome. As already observed for B.subtilis, the concordance of these two percentages corroborates the partition procedure used for the selection of typical/atypical fragments.The 13 rRNA-free atypical regions vary in size from 1.5 to 19.5 kb and make up 3.3% of the genome (Table 1, Annex 4 and Figure 3, see Annex 5 for a segmentation of the H.influenzae genome in terms of genes). About 50% of atypical regions are less than (or around) 2.5 kb long. Numbers for H.influenzae are clearly at variance with those for B.subtilis: a smaller percentage of the genome qualifies as atypical and the average size of atypical regions is also smaller. This result is examined below in the context of intra-species signature variability (see Discussion).E.coli genome analysisA clustering with six classes is required to determine the recipient species signature of E.coli. The main features are summarized in Table 1. The potential donors of the 84 RNA-free atypical regions are given in Annex 6 (for a segmentation of the E.coli genome in terms of genes, see Annex 7). It is worth noticing that 56% of E.coli potential donors belong to the Enterobacteriales family. Segmentation in terms of genes is displayed in Annex 7. The analysis of this genome is particularly useful for the comparison with literature (see below).Comparison with other methodsNumerous approaches for detecting horizontal gene transfers have been proposed in the last 2 decades. Phylogenetic trees of protein or DNA sequences, unusual distribution of genes, nucleotide composition (including codon biases) are some of the HT features that are considered within the framework of these models (16,34), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (12,14,35) and Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) (37) are some criteria that are currently employed. Each of the resulting models has its own advantages and caveats (28–30). As it has been recently pointed out by Ragan (49) and Lawrence and Ochman (50), each approach deals with a particular subset of HTs, being for example more efficient for detecting recent transfers, or more effective for the detection of ancient HTs. Our approach, which is clearly based on oligonucleotide composition, assumes that different species have different signatures but does not rely on any other assumption. It is not surprising, therefore, that the genomic signature approach provides results (in terms of % of DNA transferred) in reasonable agreement with those proposed by Garcia-Vallve (16) and Nakamura et al. (14) for the 22 species that were analyzed in common. Correlations between percentages of HTs found by these three methods are highly significant (R = 0.42, P = 10−3 and R = 0.62 and P < 10−4 between this work and Nakamura et al. and Garcia-Vallve et al., respectively; R = 0.40 and P = 2 10−3 between Nakamura et al. and Garcia-Vallve et al.). However, agreement in percentage of atypical DNA does not imply that the same genome regions are detected by different methods.Two species are extensively studied for HT content: B.subtilis (five methods including ours) and E.coli (six methods including ours). H.influenzae is also analyzed by Garcia-Vallve (16) and Nakamura (14). Comparisons of methods are presented in Tables 2–4 and detailed in Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7. A voting procedure (majority rule) has been implemented to determine the status of genes with respect to atypicality. For that task, our initial analysis is converted in terms of genes (Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7). Degree of agreement between methods is subsequently observed using the statistical Kappa coefficient (51). Kappa measures the degree of agreement on a scale from minus infinity to 1. A Kappa of one indicates full agreement, a Kappa of zero indicates that there is no more agreement than expected by chance and negative values are observed if agreement is weaker than expected by chance (a very rare situation).B.subtilis. Garcia-Vallve et al. (16), Nicolas et al. (12), Nakamura et al. (14), Moszer et al. (36) and we are the voters concerned with the analysis of B.subtilis genome (Table 2, B.subtilis). Proportions of horizontally transferred genes are quite similar (14, 13, 11, 13 and 15%, respectively). The number of detected genes per method is close, ranging from 457 for Nakamura (14) to 599 for this work (median 537). Detailed votes are given in Table 2. Among the 4100 genes of B.subtilis genome, 1011 genes are detected by at least one method (about 25% of B.subtilis genes). The number of ‘single vote’ genes ranges from 116 for Garcia-Vallve (16) to 47 for Nicolas (12). A total of 470 genes make up the majority consensus set and we detected 453 of them, which is the best score of the five methods. The best agreement with the majority consensus (in terms of Kappas) is reached by Nicolas (12), followed by our method and Moszer (36) (Table 2). Our method gets the best agreement with Nicolas (12) and the worst with the other HMM method used by Nakamura (14) (pairwise Kappa comparison, Table 2 and Supplementary Material 3). In fact, Nakamura approach is at variance with every other approach (14). It gets the lowest Kappa with the majority consensus or with whatever other methods. From Table 2, the probable number of HT genes in B.subtilis would range from 230 to 1011 with a ‘reasonable’ estimation around 470 corresponding to the majority consensus. It is to be noted that our method is unable to find two genes that are detected by every other methods (Supplementary Material 3). These genes are 338 and 236 nt long, respectively, as compared with 2500 nt, the median size of atypical regions detected by our method (Table 1). Clearly, our method is not appropriate for detecting short isolated atypical genes.H.influenzae. Garcia-Vallve (16), Nakamura et al. (14) and we are the voters concerned with the analysis of the H.influenzae genome (Supplementary Material 5 and Table 3, H.influenzae). The originality of results obtained by Nakamura (14) is the salient feature of this comparison. The number of detected HT genes is more than twice higher for Nakamura et al., whereas the part belonging to the majority consensus is the smallest (Table 3). Eleven genes are detected both by Garcia-Vallve and Nakamura (14,16) but not by our method; however, the small number of voters precludes any specific comment in this respect. The probable number of HT genes in H.influenzae would range between 11 and 273, with a ‘reasonable’ estimation around 60 (majority consensus of 57) (Table 3).E.coli. Garcia-Vallve et al. (16), Hayes and Borodovsky (35), Lawrence and Ochman (34), Nakamura et al. (14), Medigue et al. (37) and we are the voters considered for the comparison. Proportions of horizontally transferred genes are 8, 15, 28, 17, 9 and 12%, respectively. Among the 4288 genes of E.coli, 1732 are detected at least once (40% of E.coli genes), but full agreement is only observed for 64 genes (1.5%) (Table 4, E.coli). Obviously, full agreement is expected to be small if voters are numerous. The majority consensus amounts to 342 genes. This number may provide a decent estimation of HT genes in E.coli. The approach of Lawrence (34) gets the greatest number of genes in common with the majority consensus (335 out of 342) at the price of a low specificity (Kappa = 0.43, Table 4), whereas Hayes' approach (35) gets the smallest number (186 out of 342). Our method detects 261 consensual genes, a score very close to the median score of the six methods (252). Four genes (Supplementary Material 7) are detected by all methods except ours. They are isolated and their lengths are ∼750 nt. As already pointed out, our method is not suitable for the detection of short isolated HTs.The three methods in agreement with the consensus are the FCA of Medigue (37), the base composition and CAI approach of Garcia-Vallve (16) and our method (Kappa values: 0.81, 0.74 and 0.67, respectively). Pair wise comparison (Table 4), as well as correspondence analysis (Table 4, inset), shows that the HMM approach of Hayes (35) and the base composition and CAI method of Lawrence and Ochman (34) provide original results. They exhibit low Kappa values when checked against the majority consensus as well as other methods (Table 4). It is surprising that Hayes and Nakamura methods (14,35) get discordant results though they are based on similar approaches. The situation is similar for Garcia-Vallve and Lawrence methods (16,34) (Table 4).The results obtained by Hayes and Borodovsky (35) are clearly at variance with the others (Table 4). Although the proportion of claimed outliers is within the range of published numbers for E.coli (14,16,24,34,35,37), 37% of them are method-specific, and the agreement with other methods is weak (Table 4). Hayes and Borodovsky have obviously developed an approach based on HMM dealing with specific outliers. Lawrence and Ochman (34) also get a poor rating especially because they detect about twice as many genes as the other authors do (Table 4).It is worth noting that if the cut-off distance for our method is lowered, i.e. 95% instead of 99% for instance, some of the ‘single vote’ genes are dug out (for details about the impact of the cut-off distance, see Supplementary Material 7). Meanwhile, the percentage of outliers as reported by our approach rises to 20% and the percentage of ‘single vote’ genes reaches 24%. As expected, a high cut-off distance provides few single vote genes at the risk of missing some potentially transferred genes. Lowering the cut-off increases the proportion of single vote genes with the advantage of detecting most of the potential transfers (Supplementary Material 7). There is obviously a continuous grading in gene ‘atypicality’. It is suggested to first consider most ‘consensual’ genes as potential HTs and then apply amelioration models to explain the grading.Detection of recent HTsIt is difficult to assess the relevancy of proposed donors, because genes detected as potential HT have generally undergone amelioration (8). The comparison of recently diverged genomes (species or strains) provides the opportunity to find recent HTs, for which corresponding homologous genes in the donor species may be detected (52). Such a study is performed for five E.coli strains (two K12 strains: E.coli MG1655, E.coli W3110, one uropathogenic strain: E.coli CFT073, two enterohaemorrhagic strains: E.coli O157-H7 RIMD 0509952, E.coli O157-H7_EDL933) and two Shigella flexneri strains (S.flexneri 2a 2457T, S.flexneri 2a 301). These seven strains/species have recently diverged, genome sizes are different and the proportion of horizontally transferred genes varies from one strain/species to another (14,52). For instance, only ∼40% of the non-redundant set of proteins is common to E.coli strains CFT073, 0157-H7 EDL 9333 and MG1655 (53). These strains/species can be clustered in four groups with respect to phylogeny (Table 5).Two criteria are used to searching for ‘recent horizontally transferred genes’: atypical regions (window size 1 kb, step 0.5 kb) (i) must have a signature that differs greatly from that of the host [distance to host must be at least >325, 2.5 times the E.coli intrinsic mean distance (Table 1)] and (ii) must be present in a limited number of strains/species to ascertain their recentness. In fact, outliers meeting the first criterion generally aggregate into several heterogeneous clusters (K-means clustering) that usually include samples from each strain/species. In some instances, however, some strains/species were absent from the cluster. It was subsequently considered that the corresponding regions might have been recently acquired by the relevant strains/species.Table 5 shows a selection of potential recently transferred genes. Each cluster of atypical regions contains genes present in a specific set of strains. Some atypical genes are strain-specific, some are only absent in the non-pathogenic K12 strains and intermediate situations are also encountered. FASTA and Blast searches confirm that these genes are absent from some of the tested strains as already observed in the analysis complete genomes (53–55). In a large number of cases, we are able to find a well-conserved homologous gene in another species (Table 5). It is interesting to note that some of the suggested donors using our 12 000 signature database are in agreement with the species found by alignment methods. When no homologous gene is found, the proposed donors give credit to the known mechanisms of gene transfer (bacteriophages or plasmids) (Table 5).It is worth noticing that most of the selected genes that are absent in K12 strains are involved in the pathogenicity of the other strains (52). E.coli 0157-H7 is the strain exhibiting the greatest number of genes absent in K12 strains [about 1400 (54)]. It has the greatest number of genes for which no homolog can be found (Table 5). Moreover, we are unable to propose a donor for a great part of these genes (Table 5). Many selected genes for E.coli 0157-H7 lie in the Ter region of the genome (between positions 2 000 000 and 2 500 000) in agreement with the published results (56).DISCUSSIONPutative HTsWe have observed that most genomic regions are typical of the genome they belong to, using the signature as endpoint. Considering that the genomic signature is species-specific, atypicality of a region in terms of oligonucleotide usage has been promoted as a criterion for the detection of HTs. However, atypicality-based methods suffer several caveats that reduce their effectiveness in such a way that only a part of HTs can be detected. In fact, transfers between species with close signatures cannot be detected: significant differences between characteristics of transferred DNA and recipient species DNA are required. For similar reasons, HTs that were drastically ameliorated following their introduction cannot be detected either (8,14). The most stringent constraint, however, results from the size of the screening window. On the one hand, ideally, the best signal-to-noise ratio would be obtained when windows and HTs have a comparable size. On the other hand, the window size must be large enough to provide significant word counts, a requirement that strengthens with the size of the words under consideration and the intrinsic variability of the genomic signature along the genome. All together, the trade-off that has been implemented in this paper allows detecting atypical regions as small as 1 kb. In fact, rRNA regions sharing this characteristic were consistently detected. It must be pointed out that smaller fragments can be eventually detected if their signatures are radically atypical.G+C% atypicality has often been considered as criterion for detecting HTs (8,24), but this approach suffered several drawbacks (28–30). It is to be noted that our signature-based method detects regions for which the G+C% lies within one standard deviation from the mean G+C% of the species (for instance, regions 2675251–2676250 in B.subtilis or 534751–535250 in H.Influenzae, see also Supplementary Materials 2 and 4).As already observed by Nicolas et al. (12) for B.subtilis, rRNA has definitely an atypical signature. It is systematically classified as outlier, whatever the species (Table 1). Although transfer of rRNA from one species to another is unlikely (11,57), it cannot be firmly ruled out. However, it is clear that the atypical signature of rRNA does not imply that they are horizontally transferred.The signature approach has an interesting property (that it shares with HMM) (7,12,28): detection is not bound to any specific function in the genome. In contrast with most other methods, the signature approach not only detects genes, but whole transferred regions as well, in agreement with the described mechanisms of DNA exchange between species. It is to be noticed that the method allows detecting several atypical non-coding regions (Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7). One major difference between HMM and signature method lies beyond the time required for the learning process, in the few resources that HMM can mobilize to deal with a short ‘one of its kind’ HT. On the other hand, HTs shorter than 1 kb can hardly be detected by a signature-based approach. An innovative HT detector is likely to result from an adequate fusion of both methods.Potential donorsSeveral factors contribute to the efficiency of the search for donors. Of course, distance between putative HT and donor signatures is essential. Accuracy of signatures, linked to the length of available sequences, density of signatures in the ‘vicinity’ of HT, amount of amelioration sustained by HT during its presence in the host are also of importance [P. Deschavanne, S. Lespinats and B. Fertil, unpublished results; (25,27,31)]. Distance between the signature of a putative HT and the closest species varies to a large extent, but usually the shortest ones fall within the intra-genomic range (Table 1, Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). In some cases, the distance between the closest donor signature and the atypical segment signature is so great that no potential donor can be proposed (Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6).When strong similarities between a given DNA sequence and a foreign species are observed, the hypothesis for an underlying transfer is highly strengthen. However, the ‘true’ donor has to be previously sequenced and included in our bank of signatures to allow such a situation to occur. Moreover, we must take into account the intrinsic variability of short DNA segment signature (which is a function of their size, but also species-specific) when compared with the signature of a complete genome or any other large species sample (25,27,31). In the present state, our signature database is in no way representative of the diversity and richness of life. However, it must be noticed that there is already an obvious structure (in terms of distances between signatures) expressing taxonomy relationships between species in our signature database (31,58–61). Related species are often found close to one another. Clusters of potential donors may consequently provide pertinent information about the origin of HTs.The diversity of signatures of putative HTs that can be observed for most of the species analyzed in this paper reveals the multiplicity of transfer events and donors (Supplementary Materials 2, 4 and 6). However, several outliers, not necessarily neighbors in the genome, are given the same set of potential donors (Table 1, Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). In general, the potential donors belong to few sets of taxonomically close species (Table 1) and share the biotope of the host (Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). For instance, B.subtilis, H.Influenzae and E.coli live in distinct biotopes; their potential donors do so as well. It is particularly encouraging to find that most of the potential donors that our approach has pointed out have had the opportunity to exchange DNA material with the recipient species.Numerous viruses and plasmids qualify as potential donors (Tables 1 and 5, Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). It is not really surprising since they are known as HT vectors. They are often totally or partially inserted together with transferred genes in the host genome (14).Some atypical DNA segments are particularly peculiar. They are isolated, have a specific signature (distances from neighbors are great), so that they cannot be given a credible set of donors (Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). Lack of data in the search domain, shift of signature features after a substantial amelioration process, structural constraints serving special functions or roles (14,62) (as it is for rRNA coding regions) are some of the tracks that remain to explore in these circumstances.It would be interesting to localize the region the transfer may come from when the complete genome of the donor is available. However, homology (at the DNA level) is not a pertinent criterion for the comparison of sequences as soon as amelioration has taken place (8,14). In fact, homology is sometimes weak, e.g. between genes of Escherichia and Salmonella although these species have ‘recently’ diverged (34). It is clear that a more powerful search for the origin of putative HTs would have to embody models of amelioration [such as the one designed by Lawrence and Ochman (8)].When searching for very recent horizontally transferred genes, in different strains of a species for instance, it was possible to find a great homology between detected genes and some genes from other species (Table 5). In numerous cases, the selection of donors is consistent with FASTA results (Table 5). This confirms the pertinence, beyond the similarity of signature between putative HTs and donors, of the proposed method to retrieve the species of origin of a transferred region. It seems that the search for origin of HTs on the basis of genomic signature is a powerful approach to understand some of the mechanisms of evolution (13,63).CONCLUSIONOligonucleotide usage is known to be species-specific and to suffer only minor variations along the genome (25,27). Considered together, these properties allow searching for atypical local signatures that may point out DNA transfers. Results obtained with the 22 genomes analyzed in this paper are found in good agreement with literature (Tables 2–4, Supplementary Materials 3, 5 and 7) (12,14–16,24,34,35).The species specificity of signature allows searching for donor species. Quite often, sets of donor species with common taxonomic features are obtained. With the help of environmental considerations, it is subsequently possible to identify (or collect clues about) potential donors. The search for donor makes use of non-homologous sequences. Partially sequenced species become consequently eligible, inasmuch 1.5 kb of the genome is available (25,27). Thanks to the exponentially growing rate of nucleotide databanks, the search for donor species by means of the sequence signature will turn more and more pertinent and fruitful in the future. In this context, it is worth noticing that computational power is clearly not an issue since the CGR algorithm described in this paper is fast and of 0 order (calculation time is proportional to the number of nucleotides).Several methods are proposed to look for HTs. The signature method, based on different hypotheses, is complementary to those already described. It seems that each method detects preferentially certain types of HTs (49,50). In agreement with many authors (1,16,49,50,64), it appears that the conjunction of several methods is required to obtain an overview of HT extent in a genome.The signature method described in this paper generalized many approaches that ground the detection of outliers on the basis of the bias in oligonucleodides. The strong species specificity of the signature not only allows detecting various kinds of outliers but also provides clues about their possible origin. Obviously, the detection of HTs remains an open question; a consensus has still to emerge.Additional materials and experimentation with the genomic signature are available from the GENSTYLE site ().SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary Material is available at NAR Online.

  INTRODUCTIONOligonucleotide microarrays are a powerful technological platform for large-scale screens of common genetic variation and disease-causing mutations (1–5). In most published studies (6–21), oligonucleotide microarrays are designed to screen specific sequence tracts, up to megabases in length (11,15,22,23), for all possible single nucleotide substitutions. With some exceptions (24–31), the same emphasis was not placed on identifying all possible small insertions and deletions in the heterozygous state. Nevertheless, it is crucial to detect such small insertions and deletions since they can play a major role in inactivating or altering gene function by disrupting functional elements (e.g. splice junctions, cis-acting elements and open reading frames) and also represent another class of common genetic variation.Two fundamental approaches are commonly used to analyze data sets from oligonucleotide microarrays tailored to identify genetic variation in specific DNA segments purely by hybridization (1,3–5,9). One approach involves identifying statistically significant gains of target hybridization signal to oligonucleotide probes complementary to specific sequence variants (9). In theory, the gain of signal approach has the advantage of both detecting the presence of genetic variation and identifying the nature of the sequence change in the target. However, it is not feasible to screen for virtually all possible insertions and deletions due to the overwhelming number of mutation-specific probes needed for this analysis. Furthermore, little effort has been made to systematically access the hybridization properties of probes complementary to these small insertions and deletions. The second approach involves identifying losses of hybridization signal to perfect match (PM) probes that are fully complementary to the DNA segment of interest (8,25,27,30,31). In theory, the loss of signal approach allows one to screen for all possible sequence changes, including insertions and deletions, that cause a given target nucleic acid sequence to contain mismatches with specific PM probes. However, this necessitates the sequencing of specific DNA regions to identify the nature of the sequence changes (8,25,27,30,31). Thus, a combination of the gain and loss of hybridization signal analysis could provide the most robust means of identifying and characterizing mutations using non-enzymatic oligonucleotide microarray assays.Here, we analyze the specificity and reproducibility of nucleic acid hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays used in the large-scale mutational analysis of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene that is responsible for autosomal recessive disorder involving cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition and is also commonly mutated in certain lymphoid malignancies (32,33). These microarrays include 25mer oligonucleotide probes complementary to all possible single base substitutions and insertions as well as one and two base deletions on both strands of the ATM coding region. This provides the first comparative analysis of the hybridization properties of substitution, insertion and deletion probes in an oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of a large gene.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA sample selectionA series of 120 DNA samples derived from biopsies of lymphoma patients were previously screened for all possible ATM mutations using oligonucleotide microarrays (30). Here, we have selected a total of 68 samples that showed robust amplification signals in all 62 coding exons for further analysis (30). A total of 17 unique mutations, each in a one-to-one mixture with wild-type sequence, occurred once in these samples. The impact of any given mutation in a single sample is minimal given that 67 other samples with wild-type sequences in the region encompassing a given mutation are included in this analysis. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were present multiple times: 735 C/T, 2572 T/C and 4258 C/T in two samples; 3161 C/G in four samples; and 5557 G/A in five samples. Likewise, these SNPs have a minimal effect on our global analyses given the large number of samples and bases interrogated in this study.Target preparationAs previously described (30), individual ATM coding exons were amplified from genomic DNA using primers containing T3 and T7 RNA polymerase tails, pooled, and then in vitro transcribed using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase to create biotin-labeled sense and antisense strand targets, respectively. Fluorescein-labeled reference target was made using genomic DNA from an unaffected individual. Reference and test sample targets were fragmented, diluted in hybridization buffer [3 M TMA-Cl (tetramethylammonium chloride), 1× TE, pH 7.4, 0.001% Triton X-100] and hybridized to the ATM microarrays as described previously (30). Afterwards, the microarray was stained with a phycoerythrin–streptavidin conjugate and digitized hybridization images from both reference and test targets were acquired using the Gene Array Scanner (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with the appropriate emission filters.Data analysisCustom software was used to quantify hybridization signals for each probe and subtract background hybridization signals. We exclusively focused on raw data from the biotin-labeled test targets since they provide approximately seven times the hybridization signal of the fluorescein-labeled wild-type reference target in this system (28). This enhanced signal provides greater sensitivity toward detecting weak hybridization.For each sample, for each base and for each potential type of mutation (i.e. substitution, one or two base deletion or one base insertion), the specificity was calculated as the ratio of the PM probe hybridization signal of the wild-type target to their cognate insertion, deletion or single base substitution probes on each strand. The logarithm of these ratios was plotted as a function of the position within the gene. To illustrate the special patterns and to smooth out random variation, running averages of data from 10 bases were used. To capture the variability, at each base, the sample-to-sample standard deviation was again calculated using data derived from a running average of 10 bases for each sample.To estimate the mean hybridization specificity for each type of mutation, the geometric mean (i.e. the antilog of the average of the logged ratios) over all bases and over all specimens was calculated (Table 1). To further examine the variability of the specificity ratios, the coefficient of variation (cv) was calculated in two ways. The cv is the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the mean; it is useful for understanding the amount of variability relative to the magnitude of the mean or typical value. For the intra-sample cv, the cv was calculated for each of the 68 samples (using the running average of 10 at each ATM base) and the average of the 68 coefficient of variations was taken. For the inter-sample cv, at each of the bases, the cv was calculated using the 68 samples, and the average of the coefficient of variations was taken. For both calculations, the moving average of 10 was used, instead of the original value, since the goal was to understand how the specificity varied over bases and across samples, rather than to estimate the experimental (or measurement) error.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDesign of oligonucleotide probesIn order to determine the relative specificity of the hybridization of complex nucleic acid targets to oligonucleotide probes complementary to single base substitutions, insertions and deletions, we analyzed data generated from oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of the 9168 bp ATM coding region (30). These studies used a pair of oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing over 250 000 probes (25 nt in length) specifically designed to screen the sense and antisense strands of the ATM coding region for genetic variation (27,30). Collectively, the ATM sense and antisense microarrays contain 55 008 probes complementary to all possible single base substitutions, 73 344 probes complementary to all possible one base insertions, and 18 336 probes complementary to all possible one base deletions and 18 336 probes complementary to all possible two base deletions in the ATM coding sequence (Figures 1 and 2).These microarrays have been used to screen for sequence variation in the ATM gene in over 100 DNA samples (30). SNPs and gene inactivating mutations were uncovered by screening for localized losses of hybridization signal to PM probes complementary to every 25 nt segment of the ATM coding region (8,25,27,30). However, hybridization data from deletion and insertion probes were not relied upon in this analysis. Therefore, this data set provides a unique opportunity to examine the relative hybridization specificity of nucleic acid targets to each of these classes of mismatch probes.Global hybridization properties of mutation-specific probesIn order to gain a global overview of hybridization specificity, we determined the average ratio of PM probe hybridization signal of wild-type target (see Materials and Methods) to their cognate insertion, deletion and single base substitution probes on each strand (Table 1). In these calculations, we considered data for all 9168 interrogated bases in all 68 DNA samples (see Materials and Methods). For example, we report the ratio of the PM probe signal to the signal from its cognate 1 or 2 bp deletion probe. However, for single base substitutions, we report the ratio of the PM probe signal to that of the cognate substitution probe with the highest hybridization signal. This provides the most rigorous assessment of cross-hybridization to single base substitution probes. Likewise, for single base insertion probes, we report the ratio of the PM probe signal to that of the cognate insertion probe with the highest hybridization signal.For both sense and antisense strands, we found that the two base deletion probes had the highest average PM to cognate MM hybridization specificity ratio (3.26-fold sense and 4.20-fold antisense) followed by single base substitution (2.79-fold sense, 3.29-fold antisense), one base deletion (1.97-fold sense and 2.33-fold antisense) and one base insertion (1.68-fold sense and 1.87-fold antisense) probes (Table 1). To provide a finer-scale analysis of hybridization specificity, we determined the relative frequencies of hybridization specificity ratios in defined bins. There was a similar distribution of specificity ratios for single base substitution and two base deletion probes on both strands (Figure 3). The overall lower hybridization specificities of single base deletion and insertion probes are reflected by the increased frequencies of probes within the lower specificity bins (i.e. <2-fold ratio) and decreased frequencies of probes within higher specificity bins (i.e. >3-fold ratio) on both strands.Effects of sequence composition on hybridization specificityNext, we sought to uncover underlying trends in the hybridization specificity of different classes of mismatch probes across the entire ATM coding region within a given sample (intra-sample variation). This provides insights into sequence context effects that may influence the hybridization specificity of each class of mismatch probe. To approach this problem, we plotted the average hybridization specificity ratios of substitution, deletion and insertion probes for all 1168 bases across the 68 samples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 1). We analyzed data determined over running averages of 10 bases in order to maximize our ability to detect trends and minimize the effect of randomly dispersed confounding factors (e.g. intra- or intermolecular secondary structure) that may skew data for any given base.As expected from Table 1 and Figure 3, the two base deletion probes consistently showed a higher average hybridization specificity ratio followed by single base substitution, single base deletion and single base insertion probes on both strands of exon 50 (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the hybridization specificity ratios for all classes of mismatch probes fluctuate across the exon 50 sequence (Figure 4). For example, two base deletion probes showed a peak value of 6.76 (unlogged) centered at base 7071 and a trough value of 1.90 (unlogged) centered at base 7002 on the sense strand. We also found similar fluctuations in specificity ratios for all mismatch probe types in the remaining 61 ATM coding exons (Supplementary Figure 1).To assess intra-sample variability in hybridization specificity by a different means, we determined the average cv for substitution, deletion and insertion probes within a given experiment (Table 1). Again, we analyzed data from running average of 10 bases in order to maximize our ability to detect trends and maintain consistency in our data analysis. Substitution probes had the lowest average intra-sample cv, 0.31 and 0.23 for sense and antisense strands, respectively. One base deletion, two base deletion and insertion probes showed comparable intra-sample coefficients of variation on the sense strand, 0.37, 0.39, and 0.38, respectively. However, insertion probes showed relatively higher variability than the deletion probes on the antisense strand. Coupled with plots shown in Supplementary Figure 1, it is evident that of all the mismatch probe types, the hybridization specificities of base substitution probes were least affected by target sequence context.Intrigued by the above observations, we next searched for specific target sequence tracts that produced the lowest hybridization specificity among and between the different classes of mismatch probes. To approach this problem, we determined how many mismatch probes within running windows of 10 bases gave poor hybridization specificity, previously defined as a hybridization specificity ratio <1.2 (26). In Table 2, we report nucleotide tracts where at least 8 probes within a given 10 base window showed poor hybridization specificity ratios. A comprehensive listing of probes with poor hybridization specificity is provided in Supplementary Table 1.Repetitive sequence tracts, including homopolymer, homopurine and homopyrimidine, are highly represented in Table 2. Upon closer inspection, it became apparent why the cross-hybridization is strong for probes in homopolymeric regions. In these sequence contexts, substitution and deletion probes can form duplexes with wild-type target that are longer than 12 bp in length. For example, the probe designed to detect a single base deletion at position 633 is designed to form one 12 bp and one 13 bp duplex with wild-type target. However, this probe can form duplexes that range from 12 to 18 bp in length with wild-type sense strand target due to slippage (Figure 5). This type of ambiguity leads to increased stability of these DNA–RNA heteroduplexes (34).In principle, the homopurine and homopyrimidine tracts uncovered have the capacity to form higher order structures, such as triple helices (35). These tracts are known to alter the conformation and stabilities of RNA–DNA heteroduplexes (36,37), such as those formed between RNA targets and DNA probes in our system. Finally, we expect the ATM target to be especially rich in such sequence tracts given that both strands of the 3′-splice acceptor sequences, typically containing homopyrimidine tracts, for all 62 coding exons are included in the ATM target. This increases the likelihood that highly related sequence tracts in the ATM target can cross-hybridize to probes interrogating a particular homopurine or homopyrimidine sequence tract and reduce the overall hybridization specificity in this region.Next, we screened for potential structures that can form in the PM probes listed in Table 2 or their targets that could explain their poor hybridization specificity. To do this, we used Mfold (38) to calculate Gibbs free energies for intramolecular structures that can form in these PM probes and targets. Based on these Gibbs free energy values, we classified the probes and targets as having strong (S) [ΔG < (−3 kcal/mmol)], medium (M) [(−1 kcal/mmol) > ΔG > (−3 kcal/mmol)] and weak (W) [G > (−1 kcal/mmol)] potential for secondary structure. We found that several target and probe sequences could form substantial secondary structures, as displayed in Figure 6. This could artificially lower the affinity of target to PM probes and thus lower the hybridization specificity. It is more difficult to model intermolecular structure in the solution-phase complex target and in the solid-phase oligonucleotide probes. However, it appears likely that such structures could also have a similar negative impact on hybridization specificity.Consistency of hybridization data from mismatch probesThe relative variability in hybridization specificity ratios across samples (inter-sample variability) represents another important issue that should be considered in resequencing analysis (9). To uncover general trends in inter-sample variability for each type of mismatch probe, we calculated an average cv for mismatch probe hybridization specificity ratios determined over running windows of 10 bases (Table 1). Interestingly, on both strands, the single base substitution probes showed the lowest inter-sample cv. The one and two base deletion probes showed at least 2-fold higher coefficients of variation on both strands, relative to the substitution probes. Surprisingly, the one base insertion probes showed significantly higher coefficient of variations than any of the other classes of mismatch probes across samples. In fact, they are 3.5-fold higher than the corresponding substitution probes on each strand.The relative levels of inter-sample variation for all mismatch probes across exon 50 are displayed graphically in Figure 4. The error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean of the hybridization specificity ratio determined over a running window of 10 bases in each of the 68 samples. Note that the substitution probes show lower inter-sample variability than one base deletion, two base deletion and one base insertion probes, in agreement with Table 1. The variability in hybridization specificity measurements is consistent across all 62 ATM coding exons (Supplementary Figure 1).Overall, our analyses indicate that, on average, single base insertion probes show substantially lower reproducibility across experiments than base substitution, one base deletion and two base deletion probes. The increased inter- and intra-sample variability in hybridization specificity of single base insertion and deletion probes relative to single base substitution and two base deletion probes should be considered when designing and interpreting microarray-based screens for genetic variation. For a given microarray design, substantially more control hybridization experiments may be needed to determine baseline fluctuations in the hybridization specificities of insertion and deletion probes relative to those of substitution probes.Possible reasons for the hybridization properties of mismatch probesIn contrast to single nucleotide mismatches, detailed thermodynamic analyses of double helical nucleic acids with bulged nucleotides have only recently been conducted (34,39–41). In such cases, the bulged nucleotide is unpaired on only one of the nucleic acid strands. These studies are relevant to understanding the properties of the deletion and insertion probes since they can form duplexes containing bulges with target nucleic acid. For deletion probes, the bulged nucleotide is located on the target strand (Figure 7). Conversely, the insertion probes contain the bulged nucleotide in duplexes with wild-type target (Figure 7).Although subject to sequence context effects, duplexes containing a single base bulge are predicted to be more stable than those containing single nucleotide mismatches (34,39–41). This is reflected in the lower average hybridization specificity of single base deletion and insertion probes relative to that of substitution probes (Table 1 and Figure 4). Conversely, duplexes containing two base bulges are predicted to be generally less stable than those containing a single base mismatch (40,41). In part, this is due to the assumption that helical stacking is interrupted by bulges of two or greater bases in length while it is preserved for one base bulges (40,41). The higher average hybridization specificity ratios of two base deletion probes relative to substitution probes are in agreement with the predicted properties of these probes (Table 1).The considerably lower average inter-sample variability of substitution probes relative to deletion and insertion probes was unexpected given that the same target was hybridized to all mismatch probes simultaneously in the same experiment. The sources of inter-sample variation include sample preparation, hybridization conditions and the microarrays themselves. It is reasonable to assume that the microarrays themselves are not the major source of variability since the combinatorial manufacturing processes should lead to roughly equivalent synthesis quality for all the arrayed probes (42,43). It seems more likely that the insertion and deletion probes are more sensitive to subtle changes in target preparation (e.g. amount of fragmentation and dye incorporation) and hybridization conditions (e.g. target concentration, temperature and wash conditions) than the substitution probes. However, a definitive explanation for our observations will require further investigations (44–52).Caveats for the use of mismatch probes for mutation detectionIn addition to their potential value, it is important to note some of the caveats when relying upon mismatch probes for mutation detection. For example, it is important to screen for all possible sequence changes, including multiple base insertions and deletions, in mutational analyses of disease-related loci, such as the ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Given that 4N probes per base per strand are needed to screen for insertions of length N in a mixed sequence, it is unlikely that oligonucleotides complementary to insertions of two or more base pairs will be represented on microarrays screening large sequence tracts for mutations in the near future. Deletions represent a more tenable situation since only one probe per base per strand is needed to screen for a deletion of a given length in a mixed sequence. Nevertheless, there will still be limitations as to the number of deletion probes that can be realistically represented in a given microarray.Finally, it is often critical to precisely determine the nature of a sequence change within a given sample in order to properly assess its functional significance. Thus, it is important to consider error rates when assigning the identity of a mutation based on mismatch probe data. When dealing with clinical samples, it will be especially important to confirm the identity of specific sequence variants by sequencing even when dealing with slightly ambiguous hybridization data.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary Material is available at NAR Online.

      INTRODUCTION
      Sialic acids are a diverse family of acidic nine-carbon sugars
that are frequently found as terminal units of oligosaccharide
chains on different glycoconjugates in higher invertebrates and
vertebrates . As a part of determinants in many
glycoproteins , sialic acids play an important role in
intercellular and/or intermolecular recognition . The
9-O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation are the most common
modifications of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface
sialoglycoconjugates, which can alter its size, hydrophobicity,
net charge, and antigenicity . These modifications can
regulate a variety of biological phenomena, including endogenous
lectin recognition, tumor antigenicity, virus binding, and
complement activation .
      Enzymes specifically capable of removing O-acetyl esters from the
9-position of sialic acids are sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase. The enzymes in mammals have two forms, one is
cytosolic sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase (Cse) in the
cytosolic fraction and another is lysosome sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase (Lse) in the lysosomal/endosomal compartment
. Lse is likely to participate in the terminal lysosomal
degradation of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates, while Cse is
likely to salvage any 9-O-acetylated molecules that escape the
initial action of the Lse enzyme. The process of de-O-acetylation
of sialic acid, which is catalyzed by sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase, has been implicated in organogenesis and
cellular differentiation .
      Spermatogenesis is a complicated process of germ cell
differentiation in adult testis, which is established during
testicular development. There are five types of germ cells, each
at a specific developmental stage, found in the seminiferous
tubules: spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary
spermatocytes, spermatids and sperms. They can be divided into
three groups according to their DNA content: 4N DNA content cells
(4C cells), 2N DNA content cells (2C cells), and 1N DNA content
cells (1C cells). The separation of these cells enables
researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
testicular development and/or spermatogenesis. In the present
study, we separated the 2C and 4C cells of seminiferous tubules
in human adult testis by flow cytometry, and identified human
H-Lse by differential display RT-PCR. The expression pattern of
H-Lse was found to be developmentally regulated and
stage-specific, indicating its possible role in testicular
development and/or germ cell differentiation.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Preparation of disaggregated seminiferous tubules cells for the SORT
        Human testes were obtained from Donation Center of Nanjing Medical
University with consent of relatives. The seminiferous
tubules were collected in DMEM/F12, which contained collagenase,
and washed to remove the Leydig cells  as well as interstitial
cells. Trypsin treatment and a brief treatment  with
DNase I were used to release the spermatogenic cells from
seminiferous tubules. The suspension of cells was filtered with
nylon mesh.
        Disaggregated spermatogenic cells were suspended at
1 × 106 cells/mL in 0.5 M sodium citrate
solution (PH 2.35) with fresh 0.1% DEPC overnight at
room temperature and at 4°C for two days; they
were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 M sodium citrate
solution (PH 4.5) with fresh 0.1% DEPC for at
least 1 day. The day before use, the cells were
centrifuged and resuspended in PBS with 10 mM HEPES (PH
7.0), 0.1  BSA, and fresh 0.1  DEPC. Then the cells
were spun down and resuspended in PBS with
100 μg/mL
PI (propidium iodide) and fresh 0.1% DEPC. The cells
were stained overnight at 4°C .
      
      
        Flow sorting of 2C cells and 4C cells
        The flow cytometry (FCM) used in this research was
FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson, Calif)
equipped with argon laser (power: 200 mW, wavelength:
488 nm); a 585 nm/42 nm filter set was used before the FL2
detector. Cellquest (Becton Dickinson) was used for sorting
and the sorting mode was Normal-R. Drops per sort were
3 and drop delay was 13.6. The density of cells for sorting was
about 1 × 106 cells/mL.
      
      
        RNA isolation and differential display PCR
        Isolation of total RNA from 2C cells and 4C cells was performed
with Trizol Reagent (Gibco BRL, Ontario). One hundred
nanograms of total RNA was used for differential display RT-PCR
. The first chain cDNA was synthesized by using T12G,
T12C, and T12A oligo (dT) primers, and then was used as template
in PCR. PCR was performed as follows: 94°C, 1 minute;
37°C, 1 minute; 72°C, 2 minutes for 40 cycles. Ten
microlitres of the PCR products from the two cells were run on a
1.5% agarose gel. The fragments highly or specifically displayed
in 4C cells were excised and purified. This DNA was reamplified
with the same combination of primers and then subcloned into
Pinpoint Xa1-T vector (Promega, USA).
      
      
        cDNA library screening
        The colonies of full-length cDNA were screened by PCR.
Human Testis Large-Insert  cDNA Library (Clontech, Calif) was first converted into
plasmid cDNA Library, and then an arrayed cDNA library in 96-well
plates was made according to the method of Munroe .
In this arrayed cDNA library 1.54 × 106 colonies were
screened by PCR.
      
      
        Northern blot analysis
        Multiple tissue northern (MTN) blots (Clontech) were
hybridized with the 32P-labeled probes. The probe
corresponding to 1378–1634 bp of H-Lse was used for
hybridization. After stringent wash, the blot was placed on the
storage phosphor screen (Packard, USA)  and
exposed for 3 hours in the dark. The signal was detected at the
Cyclone storage phosphor system (Packard).
      
      
        Chromosome mapping of H-Lse
        The Stanford TNG Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics,
Huntsville, Ala) was used to map the chromosomal localization of
HSE with primers HSEmapF (5′-ATGAACACCGTCTCCACC-3′) and HSEmapR
(5′-AAATCTGAAGGACCCATC-3′), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. After 35 cycles of amplification, the
reaction products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The
positive amplification was labeled as 1 and the negative one was
labeled as 0. The results were analyzed through the Stanford
genome center web server to determine the probable chromosomal location.
      
      
        In situ hybridization of human testis
        RNA DIG-labeled probes were made by in vitro transcription. T7
and SP6 promoter sequences were incorporated into the two sides
of the templates (195–553 bp of H-Lse) by PCR, sense and
antisense probes were made using DIG-RNA labeling mix (Roche,
USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After fixation, paraffin embedding, mounting, and sectioning,
sections of human embryonic and adult testes were prehybridized in
hybridization buffer (DIG Easy Hyb, Roche, Germany) at
42°C for 2 hours. Hybridization was carried in
hybridization buffer containing appropriate probes at 65°C
for 16 hours in humidity chamber.
      
      
        Subcellular localization of H-Lse
        Subcellular localization of HSEI and HSEII was performed by the
method of green fluorescent protein. pEGFP-C2-HSEI AND
pEGFP-C2-HSEII were constructed using two sets of primers (HSEI:
5′-GGGGAATTCAATGATATGGTGCTGCAG-3′ and
5′-GGGGTCGACATTTAGCAACATTGCTCTG-3′; HSEII:
5′-GGGGAATTCATGGTCGCGCCGGGGCTTG-3′ and
5′-GGGGTCGACATTTAGCAACATTGCTCTG-3′) and EcoRI/SalI
restriction sites of pEGFP-C2. Recombinant vectors were
 transfected into BxPC-3 cells (BxPC-3 cell is a
cell lineage of adenocarcinoma from pancreas) by Lipofectin
reagent (Gibco BRL). Cells were imaged 40 hours after
transfection on the fluorescence microscope.
      
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Identification of H-Lse by differential display RT-PCR
        After being stained with PI and measured by the FCM, three groups
of cells in seminiferous tubules of human adult testis were
detected (Figure 1), 2C and 4C cells were
subsequently sorted. A clone was identified by differential
display RT-PCR, which was highly expressed in the 4C cells
(Figure 2) and with high homology (86%) to  a mouse
lysosome sialic acid 9-O-acetylesterase. The clone was named H-Lse.
      
      
        Structural characteristic of H-Lse
        In the two rounds of screening in the arrayed cDNA library, the
plasmid containing full-length H-Lse (GenBank accession number:
AF303378) was found. H-Lse is 2750 bp in length, encoding a
putative protein of 523 amino acids with a molecular weight of
58 kd. Its isoelectric point is 7.19. The N terminus 
(1–18 aa) of the protein is a region containing hydrophobic amino acid
residues, which may be a signal peptide. By comparison of the
protein sequences (Figure 3), we hypothesized that
H-Lse is the human counterpart of mouse lysosome sialic acid
9-O-acetylesterase.
      
      
        Chromosome localization of H-Lse
        After PCR amplification, the results can be shown as a pattern
(000000001000101000000110000010000000110000010000010000010010000000100000000001001001000001).
Retrieving results from the Stanford genome center web server shows that HSE is localized in the human 11q24
(Figure 4).
      
      
        Northern blot analysis of human tissue
        The distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues was analyzed
by Northern blot (Figure 5) and the results showed
the presence of three distinct mRNA species at approximately
2.7 kb, 6.0 kb, and 7.5 kb. The expected transcript of
H-Lse was approximately 2.7 kb and it was consistently
expressed in all the tissues examined with high expression found
in the testis, prostate, and colon. The transcript of
approximately 7.5 kb was exclusively expressed
in the colon. The transcript of approximately
6.0 kb was distributed in the testis, colon,
small intestine, prostate, and thymus, with the highest level of
expression found in the testis.
      
      
        Developmental and spermatogenic stage-specific localization of H-Lse
        To examine a possible role of H-Lse in testicular development
and/or spermatogenesis, in situ hybridization experiments were
conducted to compare H-Lse expression in human embryonic and
adult testes since spermatogenesis is not initiated in the embryo
and there is no meiosis in embryonic seminiferous tubules. The
results showed that no signal was detected in the embryonic
testis, while positive signals were detected in spermatocytes but
not spermatogonia in the seminiferous tubules of adult testis.
Signals were associated with germ cells but not other somatic
cells in the testis, that is, Sertoli and Leydig cells. Negative
control of sense probes confirmed the specificity of the results
(Figure 6).
      
      
        Lysosomal localization of H-Lse
        The subcellular localization of H-Lse
fusion proteins was visualized by transiently transfecting H-Lse
gene fused with GFP into BXPC-3 cells. As shown in Figure 7,
the control cells transfected with GFP protein alone exhibited
fluorescence evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, while
GFP-H-Lse fusion protein was compartmentalized in numerous large
dense-core vesicles in the cytoplasm.
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      Spermatogenesis is a developmental program that occurs in
mitotic, meiotic, and postmeiotic phases. In the mitotic phase,
spermatogonia proliferate to expand the quantity of germ cells;
in the meiotic phase, spermatocytes accomplish chromosomal
synapsis and genetic recombination before two meiotic divisions;
and in the postmeiotic phase, haploid spermatids are remodeled
into spermatozoa by the processes of acrosome formation, nuclear
condensation, flagellar development, and loss of the majority of
cytoplasm. Under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
spermatogenesis is characterized by the expression of a spectrum
of genes that are cell-type-specific or stage-specific. They are
thought to play an essential role in spermatogenesis at
particular stages. For example, MutS homologue 5 is
required for chromosome pairing, CPEB and SCP3 are
required for synaptonemal complex assembly and chromosome
synapsis in primary spermatocytes .

      In the present study, we have identified a gene, H-Lse,
from human adult testis with high
homology to mouse Lse. The subcellular localization of
GFP-H-Lse fusion protein showed that H-Lse is concentrated in
vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm, presumably the
lysosomes, indicating that H-Lse is likely to be the lysosome
form of sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. However, our
northern blot analysis shows transcripts of different sizes with
different tissue distributions. They may be the tissue-specific
transcripts of H-Lse since others have reported that there are
multiple transcripts of mouse sialic-acid-specific
9-O-acetylesterase . The wide distribution of the
 expected transcript of H-Lse, approximately
2.7 kbp,  in all tissues examined suggests an
essential role of H-Lse in cellular functions.
      As the most common modification  of sialic acids found in
mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, 9-O-acetylation and
de-O-acetylation play an important role in the transition of
antigenicity and transformation of intercellular cross-talk.
9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can mask some epitopes. For
example, natural ligands of the B-cell adhesion molecule CD22
beta can be masked by 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids .
Similarly, it can inhibit binding of sialoadhesin, a
macrophage-restricted and sialic-acid-dependent adhesion molecule
. On the other hand, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids can
form novel epitopes. Influenza virus C haemagglutinin
specifically requires 9-O-acetylated sialic acids for binding to
host cells . Incubation of red blood cells with sialate
9-O-acetylesterase rendered the erythrocytes resistant against
agglutination by influenza C virus . O-acetylation of
disialoganglioside GD3 by human melanoma cells has been reported
to create a unique antigenic determinant . Modifications
of sialic acids may be an important mechanism underlying the
interaction/cross-talk between different types of cells. The
essential role of sialic acids modification in cellular
communications may explain the presently observed wide
distribution of H-Lse in all examined tissues.
      The present study suggests that the expression of H-Lse is
developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific. The
evidence for this includes: (1) lack of expression in embryonic
testis; (2) association of high level of mRNA detected by
DD-RT-PCR with the 4C but not 2C cells in adult testes; and (3)
detection of in situ hybridization signal in spermatocytes but
not spermatogonia or other somatic cells. In the absence of
spermatogenesis, embryonic testis contains only two distinct cell
types, spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, while the seminiferous
epithelium of adult testis consists of germ cells at different
stages of spermatogensis. The 4C cells found in adult testis
include the primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia of G2/M
stage, while 2C cells include spermatogonia of G0/G1 stage,
secondary spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells. The absence of H-Lse
mRNA in embryonic testis and the high level of its mRNA in the 4C
cells of adult testis suggest that its expression is restricted
to spermatocytes, particularly the primary spermatocytes.
Together with the in situ hybridization results showing mRNA of
H-Lse restricted to spermatocytes, but not spermatogonia, Sertoli
cells or interstitial cells, these data suggest that
H-Lse is likely to be involved in the process of spermatogenesis,
although its role in testicular development cannot be entirely
ruled out. Unfortunately, due to the deformation of the available
human testes, we were not able to make further distinction
between primary and secondary spermatocytes. What has been
clearly shown by the present data is that H-Lse is only present
at a stage beyond spermatogonia, suggesting its possible role in
the differentiation of germ cells.
      Interestingly, the processes of 9-O-acetylation and
de-O-acetylation of sialic acid have been implicated in
organogenesis and cellular differentiation, since alteration of
these processes could lead to interruption of cellular
development such as embryogenesis. Transgenic mice constitutively
overexpressed the 9-O-acetyl-sialic-acid-specific esterase of
influenza C that has been found to arrest embryo development at the
two-cells stage. It has also been reported that in vitro
development of embryonic stem cells shows that the expression
level of Lse is low at the initiation of the development, and
followed by an increase at later stages . In transgenic
mice with selective expression of 9-O-acetyl-sialic-acid-specific
esterase in retina and the adrenal gland, these organs showed
various abnormalities in organization, while all other tissues
appeared normal . Lse has also been considered to play a
key role in the differentiation of B lymphocyte , since
it is expressed in late but not early B lymphocyte. The presently
observed development-dependent pattern of H-Lse expression is
consistent with that found in other cell types: absence or low
expression at early stage of differentiation but high at later
stages. Taken together, 9-O-acetyl esters in sialic acids appear
to be important for development or cellular differentiation.
      Spermatogenesis is a multiple-staged continuous progress of
cellular differentiation. It has been reported that some cell
surface glycoconjugates are modified during the early steps of
spermatogenesis, and influence the differentiation of
spermatogenic cells . As nine-carbon sugars commonly found in
many glycoproteins of spermatogenic cells, sialic acids represent
a target for cell surface modification,  that is, removal of
9-O-acetyl esters by enzymes such as Lse.  Modification of sialic
acids may result in alteration in cell-cell communication,  that is,
Sertoli cells and germ cells interaction, thereby influencing the
differentiation of spermatogenic cells. Thus, future studies on
the presently identified H-Lse may provide insight into molecular
mechanisms underlying testicular development and/or germ cell
differentiation during spermatogenesis in humans.

      Background
      Although pain is the presenting symptom of most patients with chronic pancreatitis, its neurobiological basis remains poorly understood . In the past, investigators have focused on the role of anatomical abnormalities such as a strictured pancreatic duct or narrowed intraparenchymal ducts. However, mechanical decompression techniques such as endoscopic stent placement or even surgical pancreatojejunostomy frequently do not provide a permanent solution to the pain . More recently, investigators have begun focusing on the role of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins such as substance P and nerve growth factor with known or suspected roles in nociceptive signaling and/or sensitization and have reported an increased expression of several of them in the pancreas of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis . Mast cells are also increased in both acute and chronic pancreatitis  but their role in the generation of pain in pancreatitis has not been investigated.
      We hypothesized that mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis. This hypothesis is based on the following observations. First, mast cells have been associated with human conditions in which pain is a predominant symptom. Interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome are both conditions in which pain is out of proportion to the objective pathological findings . In both conditions, an increase in the number of mast cells has been described in the bladder and the colon, respectively . Further, mast cells are frequently found in close proximity to nerves in the intestinal mucosa and the bladder [7-9]. This has also been observed in the pancreas – the total number of mast cells was significantly higher in pancreatic tissue from patients with chronic pancreatitis than in the normal pancreatic controls . One of the preferential locations of mast cells was around and within the perineurium of nerve fibers in tissue samples of patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting the potential for interactions between mast cells and the nervous system. Lastly, there is evidence for bi-directional functional communication between mast cells and nerves [10-12]. Mast cells can not only release mediators that increase excitability of neurons but in turn, neurotransmitters such as substance P can trigger mast cell degranulation . Mast cells may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of pain in pancreatitis through degranulation products that can sensitize pancreatic afferent neurons in an ongoing vicious circle of neuronally mediated mast cell degranulation.
      Our first aim was to analyze the presence and distribution of mast cells in autopsy specimens of chronic pancreatitis and study the correlation, if any, with historical documentation of pain. We then explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type and KitW/KitW-v mice, a strain deficient in mast cells (MCDM).
    
    
      Methods
      
        Data collection autopsy study
        Autopsy records from the University of Texas Medical Branch from the years 1993 to 2000 were searched electronically for the term ""pancreatitis."" One-hundred sixty-six patients were identified of which 26 patients carried an autopsy diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and 140 patients carried a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The medical charts from patients with an autopsy diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis were reviewed for documentation of a medical history of chronic pancreatitis. If no such documentation was present in the chart, patients were excluded from the study (12/26). Thus, 14/26 patients with both a documented history and an autopsy based diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, were included in the study. Patients were categorized as painful chronic pancreatitis (8/26) when they fulfilled one of the following criteria: a documented history of chronic abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis that required the use of narcotics, and/or frequent admissions for recurrent abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis, and/or a surgical or endoscopic procedure for refractory abdominal pain clinically attributed to chronic pancreatitis. Patients were categorized as non-painful chronic pancreatitis (6/26) if patients did not fit any of the criteria listed under painful chronic pancreatitis. In addition, the following data were collected: demographic factors (age and race), cause of death, comorbidities, clinical history of pancreatitis, etiology of pancreatitis, diagnostic studies supporting a diagnosis of pancreatitis (amylase, lipase, calcifications on abdominal plain film, CT-scan, ultrasound or ERCP). Human pancreatic control tissue was obtained from 8 arbitrarily chosen patients of whom the autopsy records recorded acute myocardial infarction as the cause of death. Their medical records were reviewed to ensure that they did not have a clinical history of pancreatitis. Therefore there were three categories of patients: one with painful chronic pancreatitis, one with non-painful chronic pancreatitis and non-pancreatitis controls. A pathologist, blinded to the group assignment, verified all histological diagnoses and counted mast cells on a Giemsa stained tissue section (average of 10 high-power randomly chosen (40X) fields per specimen). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Medical Branch.
      
      
        Mice strains
        All mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male mice were used from the following strain: WBB6F1/j-KitW/KitW-v (MCDM) and the respective littermate control mouse strain, KitW-v – +/+ (WT). The mice were 3 months of age at the onset of the experiment with body weights of 25–30 gram.
        Experimental protocols involving mice were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in accordance with the guidelines provided by the National Institutes of Health.
      
      
        Induction of chronic pancreatitis
        Mice were anesthetized with sodium Nembutal (50 mg/kg body weigh, i.p.) Following a midabdominal laparotomy, a canula was introduced into the common pancreato-biliary duct; the duct was ligated proximally and distally to ensure perfusion into the pancreas and prevent entry of the injected substance into the liver or duodenum. 0.1 ml of 1% TNBS in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-10% ethanol, pH 8, was infused into the pancreas (modified after Puig-Divi ). The canula was removed and the abdomen closed. Control mice were treated in the exact same fashion but were perfused with saline instead (Figure 1). Mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after surgery.
      
      
        Von Frey Filament (VFF) measurements
        VFF hairs consist of a series of filaments of increasing diameter that produce increasing sensations of touch when applied to the skin. When the tip of a fiber of given length and diameter is pressed against the skin, the force of application increases until the fiber bends. After the fiber bends, continued advance creates more bend, but not more force of application. This principle makes it possible to apply a reproducible force to the skin surface. VFF testing is an established behavioral pain assay used to determine mechanical pain thresholds in somatic pain. More recently, VFF testing has been used as a surrogate marker for visceral pain .
        Mice were placed in a cage with a mesh floor and habituated to the environment for 30–60 minutes. Measurements were taken from the abdomen and the plantar surface of both hindpaws over a period of three weeks prior to the surgery and for a total of three weeks after the surgery (Figure 1). VFF filaments of various caliber were applied to the mid-abdomen in ascending order 10 times, each for 1–2 seconds with a 10 second interval. A response was defined as: a) sharp retraction of the abdomen; b) immediate licking or scratching of site of application of hair; or c) jumping. The response frequency was defined as the total number of responses out of 10 applications (expressed as a percentage) to the skin per filament. An investigator blinded to the different treatment groups performed the behavioral testing.
      
      
        Pancreatic histology
        Fresh specimens of the mouse pancreas were fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 containing 1 mM MgCl2 at 4°C overnight. Sections from paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxyline and eosin and observed under a light microscope. Pathological changes were scored based on a scale described by Tito et al. by a pathologist blinded to the different treatment groups .
      
      
        Data expression and statistical analysis
        Comparisons of the number of mast cells in autopsy specimen were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.
        For each behavioral experiment (see figure 1), the average response frequency was calculated as the mean of the mean response frequencies for each mouse (across four measures). The ""post-pre response frequency"" was calculated by subtracting the pre-surgical average response frequency from the post-surgical average response frequency. To assess the independent effect of TNBS on VFF response (ie. to control for the effect of the surgery itself), the post-pre response frequency for TNBS infusion was compared with the post-pre response frequency for saline infusion. This comparison was performed using analysis of variance for a two-factor experiment with repeated measures on time at each level of force for each type of mice (WT and MCDM). The two factors were induction of pancreatitis or not (TNBS or saline, respectively) and time (pre-surgical or post-surgical). TNBS infusion was considered to have had an independent effect on the VFF response if the post-pre response frequency was greater for TNBS than for saline infusion.
        Fisher's least significant difference procedure was used for multiple comparisons of least squares means with Bonferroni adjustment for number of comparisons. All effects and interactions were assessed at the 0.05 level of significance. Data analysis was conducted using PROC MIXED with LSMEANS options in SAS®, Release 8.2 [SAS Institute Inc., SAS/STAT® User's Guide, Version 8, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc., 1999].
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Autopsy data
        Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. Alcohol abuse was the most common cause for pancreatitis in both groups. Analysis of our results, using the Mann-Whitney U test, revealed significantly more mast cells in patients with a history of painful chronic pancreatitis (n = 8) when compared to patients with either non-painful chronic pancreatitis (n = 6) (33.8 vs 9.4 average mast cell count/10 high power fields; p < 0.01) or controls (n = 8), (33.8 vs 6.1 average mast cell count/10 high power fields; p < 0.01) (Figure 2). The increased number of mast cells in patients with painful pancreatitis was noted predominantly in interstitial areas and, to a lesser degree, in the periacinar space.
      
      
        Withdrawal responses to mechanical stimulation of the abdomen and paw after induction of chronic pancreatitis
        Figure 3 shows the post-pre surgical response frequency for both WT and MCDM. TNBS had a significant independent effect on abdominal VFF response in WT mice at the force levels 4 and 8 mN (p = 0.007 and 0.037, respectively) (Figure 3A). There was a trend towards a significant effect at the force level of 16 mN (p = 0.066). In contrast, for MCDM, TNBS had no significant effect on abdominal VFF response at any force level (Figure 3B). There was no significant TNBS effect on VFF response in the left hindpaw for either WT mice or MCDM (Figure 4). Data not shown for the right hindpaw.
      
      
        Histological analysis of mice pancreas following TNBS injection
        Pancreatic histology confirmed the presence of chronic pancreatitis in both WT and MCDM with marked fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates and ductular proliferation mimicking changes seen in human chronic pancreatitis (Figure 5A). The pancreas of saline treated controls was normal. There was no significant difference in the overall inflammatory scores between the WT and MCDM (Figure 5B). An increased number of mast cells were counted in WT mice with chronic pancreatitis compared to saline treated controls (5.6 vs 1.5; p = 0.05) (Figure 6). As to be expected, no mast cells were present in pancreas of MCDM.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Chronic pancreatitis has been defined as a continuing inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by irreversible morphologic changes that typically cause pain and/or permanent loss of function . The pathogenesis of pain in this condition remains to be satisfactorily established. We examined the association, if any, of pain with mast cells as quantified in autopsy specimens of patients with a history of painful and non-painful chronic pancreatitis and normal controls. Significantly more mast cells were present in pancreatic tissue from patients with a history of painful chronic pancreatitis, indicating an association with this condition and a potential role for these cells in the pathogenesis of pain in painful chronic pancreatitis.
      There are clearly limitations to a retrospective, autopsy-based study such as the one we report here. For instance, we do not know whether pain was present at the time of death and there was incomplete information on the different patterns of pain. Also, our findings pertain mainly to patients with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis. Nevertheless, our findings do suggest an association of painful chronic pancreatitis with an increased number of mast cells. This observation provided the rationale for further experimental testing, which we performed in mice. We first developed a model of chronic pancreatitis in mice following a modified protocol first described by Puig- Divi et al. . Histological changes consisted of periductal and lobular fibrosis, duct stenosis, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates, and gland atrophy, mimicking features of chronic pancreatitis in humans. Significantly more mast cells were present in WT mice with chronic pancreatitis, adding to the validity of this model for use in studies on the role of mast cells in pancreatitis. Both WT and MCDM developed histological changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis, indicating that the elimination of mast cells did not modulate the animals' ability to mount an inflammatory response. Therefore, any changes observed in pain behavior are unlikely to stem from differences in underlying inflammation.
      Next we determined whether this mouse model could be used to study behavioral differences associated with chronic pancreatitis. The assessment of spontaneous pain in a visceral organ presents significant difficulties. We have used a behavioral method to assess this, which relies on the association of visceral pain with sensitization of somatic regions of the body that share segmental innervation at the level of the spinal cord (referred pain). This somatic sensitization can be quantified using VFF to stimulate the somatotopically appropriate abdominal region and measuring the abdominal withdrawal response. Thus, VFF testing of the anterior abdominal wall can be used as a surrogate marker for visceral pain. Although this is the first time that this technique has been used for the measurement of referred visceral hyperalgesia in a mouse model of chronic pancreatitis, this method has previously been described and validated to assess the severity of referred visceral pain for models of colonic hypersensitivity  as well as rat models of acute necrotizing pancreatitis  and chronic pancreatitis . The abdominal VFF response was compared to the hind paw response to assess the specificity of the interventions to the pancreas. TNBS treated mice, but not the saline control, developed increased abdominal wall withdrawal responses to VFF testing when compared to baseline, suggesting the development of force-dependent referred hyperalgesia of the abdominal wall in WT mice. There was no evidence of referred hyperalgesia in the hindpaws, suggesting that the measured effect on abdominal withdrawal is specific for an intra-abdominal origin of the pain. Vera-Portocarrero et al. previously described similar findings, increased withdrawal frequency after VFF stimulation to the abdominal area, in a rat model of chronic pancreatitis . These behavioral changes were abrogated by morphine. Rats that demonstrated behavioral changes also expressed increased substance P expression in the nociceptive layers of the spinal cord, suggestive of central nociceptive changes.
      Mast cells produce a variety of degranulation products in the setting of inflammation that may activate and/or sensitize primary nociceptive neurons. The neurotrophin growth factor (NGF) is one such product [19-22]. NGF is released in the setting of inflammation and can not only function as a chemoattractant for other mast cells, but it can also trigger mast cell degranulation . We are speculating that NGF production in the inflamed pancreas is responsible for plastic changes in the sensory neurons by activating proalgesic receptors and channels such as the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) and Transient Receptor Potential Family V receptor 1 (TRPV1; previously known as VR1) thereby contributing to the generation of pain [24-26]. Similarly, other mast cell degranulation products such as tryptase and histamine are capable of modulating neuronal function [27-32]. Tryptase may directly activate the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a G-protein coupled receptor expressed by pancreatic nerves, important in the pathogenesis of pain in pancreatitis . Although the role for mast cells in the mediation of visceral nociceptive signaling needs to be explored further, we speculate that mast cell products released in pancreatitis, contribute to the development of pain by direct effects on nociceptors located on pancreatic afferent neurons (Figure 7).
      However, before concluding a definite role for mast cells from our experimental data, it should be noted that MCDM carry a spontaneous mutation for tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit which not only produces a deficiency of mast cells but may have an independent effect on the function of sensory neurons, which are known to express it . Therefore, it remains to be determined whether the detected differences in nociceptive responses is due to the absence of mast cells per se or a yet unknown change in the responsiveness of sensory neurons due to a congenital lack of the c-kit receptor. Reconstitution of mast cells into the MCDM mice should restore their nociceptive responses close to the wild type phenotype.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Our data should increase awareness of the importance of mast cells in the pathogenesis of painful inflammatory conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and encourage experimental studies for further testing of this hypothesis.

      Introduction
      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains an underestimated problem in ICU patients, despite the findings of many randomized controlled trials performed in the field of DVT prophylaxis after surgery during the past few decades . Several consensus statements have been reported  that summarize the conclusions of those studies. The Canadian survey reported in the present issue of Critical Care  provides a useful snapshot of daily clinical practice in Canada with regard to DVT prophylaxis. It strongly suggests that studies dedicated to DVT prophylaxis in ICU patients should be performed in order to develop useful recommendations. Furthermore, a great effort would have to be made to educate physicians regarding both DVT screening and pharmacological aspects.
    
    
      A difficult diagnosis
      Clinicians should be aware that DVT in ICU patients has unusual characteristics that make its clinical diagnosis difficult. Physical examination is rarely helpful because DVT is generally asymptomatic. This was demonstrated in the study of Geerts et al. , in which the clinical signs of DVT (e.g. oedema, pain and flushing) occurred in less than 1.5% of patients. As a result, physicians are often lulled into an inappropriate sense of security. Moreover, the diagnosis is not always easy to confirm. The insensitivity of Doppler ultrasound and the major difficulty in performing venography in ICU patients generally lead to blind anticoagulant prophylaxis. Even when a pulmonary embolism leads to death, diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in a patient who has already been treated and ventilated for a pulmonary condition because autopsies are rarely conducted in trauma victims. As stated at the most recent American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference , however, trauma patients represent a group that is at very high risk for DVT. The discussion should therefore no longer focus on the incidence of thrombosis, but rather on the different methods of prevention that could be used.
    
    
      Traditional and advanced compression techniques
      Graded elastic stockings do not provide adequate prophylaxis in high-risk patients . Most of the Canadian respondents in the survey appear to be aware of this, which would explain why up to 34% of ICU directors do not consider mechanical prophylaxis at all. It has been strongly suggested, however, that elastic stockings should be combined with LMWH . Combining noninvasive with pharmacological prophylaxis has been shown to be beneficial , and should therefore be encouraged. It is also cost-effective and easy to use.
      In order to improve the benefit from such combinations of mechanical and pharmacological measures, new mechanical devices for DVT prophylaxis are being developed. Classic intermittent pneumatic compression devices applied directly to the entire leg are often difficult to use because of fractures, immobilization with plaster casts, or external fixation instruments. With a venous foot pump these difficulties are eliminated. The foot pump is designed to overcome the venous stasis that is associated with surgery. It flattens the metatarsal arch, emptying the venous plexus (30 ml blood) and thus reproducing the effect of normal weight-bearing. The efficacy of the foot pump has already been demonstrated in level II and III studies.
      A recent large, prospective, randomized study conducted in 274 patients with total hip replacement  compared the safety and effectiveness of the foot pump with those of LMWH prophylaxis. That study showed no significant difference between the two methods; DVT was detected in 24 (18%) patients randomized to foot pump prophylaxis as compared with 18 patients (13%) randomized to receive the LMWH enoxaparin. There was no difference in the transfusion requirements or intraoperative blood losses between the two groups. This new method could be helpful in trauma, neurological, or neurosurgical patients when anticoagulants are contraindicated.
      In summary, mechanical prophylaxis should systematically be used alone or in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis in ICU patients.
    
    
      Unfractionated versus low-molecular-weight heparin
      Although unfractionated heparin (5000 IU administered subcutaneously two or three times per day) is used extensively in the Canadian centres, there is considerable evidence  that these small doses of heparin are relatively ineffective in comparison with doses used in orthopaedic surgery. In the literature, selection of unfractionated heparin was supported by DVT detection methods, such as echography and Duplex scanning. These methods are unacceptable because of their low sensitivity in asymptomatic patients, especially in the ICU. Administration of LMWH has been shown to result in significantly better results.
      In 1996, Geerts et al.  showed that 30 mg enoxaparin given twice daily exhibited superior antithrombotic efficacy as compared with subcutaneous heparin 5000 IU twice daily. The overall venographic DVT rate was reduced from 44 to 31%, and the proximal DVT rate from 15 to 6% in patients receiving heparin and enoxaparin, respectively. Since then, only one relevant study has been reported, which compared LMWH with placebo in ICU patients . In that study, nadroparin was able to decrease the DVT rate significantly, but no direct comparison between LMWH and unfractionated heparin was undertaken.
      Although there is still insufficient data in the ICU setting, the large amount of data gathered by surgical trials should allow extrapolation. LMWH appears to be effective and safe postoperatively, and hence should probably be recommended in ICU patients except when renal function is impaired and in very old patients . The optimal duration of treatment has not been defined, but it appears reasonable to suggest that prophylaxis with LMWH should be continued for as long as risk factors are present, such as inflammation, sepsis and immobilization.
      New compounds such as recombinant hirudin  and pentasaccharide  should be evaluated in these very high risk patients because those agents have exhibited high efficacy in preventing DVT after total hip replacement surgery. They may be particularly useful in those settings in which thrombotic risk rapidly exceeds haemorrhagic risk. Oral anticoagulants cannot be recommended in trauma patients because some have to undergo multiple surgical procedures. In addition, interactions between vitamin K antagonists and other drugs used in this setting may be hazardous.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Thrombotic complications (DVT, pulmonary emboli) are a major concern in ICU patients and still occur in a significant number of patients. Antithrombotic agents, and LMWH in particular, should be considered in a systematic manner, except for those cases in which they are contraindicated. The optimal dosage for prophylaxis with LMWH is not well defined. Pharmacological prophylaxis should always be combined with mechanical prophylaxis. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these recommendations. Finally, educational programmes should be implemented that include epidemiological and therapeutic aspects of VTE prevention.
